present collection were contributed by the writer to the <i>Indian
Antiquary</i> fourteen years ago in a series of articles under the
title of &ldquo;Glimpses of Sinhalese Social Life&rdquo;; they are now
offered, amplified and rearranged, to the student of folklore in
Ceylon, as a basis for further research. The writer has adopted the
scheme of classification in the Folklore Society&rsquo;s Hand Book of
Folklore.</p>

<p class="par first">Various beliefs are held by the peasantry about
the hills, rocks, boulders and crags scattered about the island.</p>
<p class="par">Samanala Kanda (Adam&rsquo;s Peak) which contains the
sacred foot print of the Buddha was in prehistoric times sacred to the
god Saman who still presides over the mountain. Pilgrims to the Peak
invoke his aid in song for a safe journey; and when they reach the top,
cover the foot print with four yards of white cloth, pay obeisance to
it, recite the articles of the Buddhist Faith, and make a silver
offering at the shrine of the Saman Deviyo, which is close by. When
worship is over the pilgrims greet each other and sound a bell ringing
as many peals as they have visited the Peak.</p>
<p class="par">No lizard is heard chirping within the shadow of
Hunasgiriya Peak in Pata Dumbara for when the Buddha, on his aerial
visit to Ceylon, wished to alight on this mountain a lizard chirped and
he passed on to Adam&rsquo;s Peak.</p>
<p class="par">Ritigal Kanda (Sanskrit Arishta) in the Nuvara
Kal&acirc;viya district, S.E. of Anuradhapura and Rummas Kanda (modern
Buona Vista) in the Galle district are associated with the Hanuman
tradition. It was from Ritigal Kanda that Hanuman jumped across to
India to carry the joyful message that he had discovered Sita in
Ceylon, and when Lakshman was wounded and a medicinal herb was required
for his cure, Hanuman was sent to the Himalayas to fetch it; on the way
the name and nature of the plant dropped from his memory; whereupon he
snapped a portion of the Himalayas and brought it twisted in his tail
and asked Rama to seek for the herb himself. Buona Vista is that
portion of the mountain and valuable medicinal herbs are still to be
found there.</p>
<p class="par">R&acirc;van&acirc; Kotte,&mdash;the stronghold of
R&acirc;van&acirc; (king of the Rakshas)&mdash;was off Kirinda in the
Hambantota District and is now submerged. The Great Basses are what is
left of this city; the golden twilight seen there of an evening is the
reflection of the brazen roofs of the submerged city.</p>
<p class="par">Dehi Kanda opposite the Dambulla rock caves in the
Matale district is the petrified husk of the rice eaten by the giants
who made the caves.</p>
<p class="par">Near Sinigama in Wellaboda pattu of the Galle district
is shewn a crag as the petrified craft in which W&ecirc;ragoda Deviyo
came to Ceylon from South India.</p>
<p class="par">When a severe drought visited the island, an elephant, a
tortoise, a beetle, an eel, a goat and a she elephant went in search of
water to the tank Wen&ecirc;ru Veva near Kurunegala. A woman who saw
this kept a lump of salt before the foremost of them, the elephant;
while he was licking it she raised a screen of leaves to conceal the
tank from the intruders&rsquo; view and began to pray; and the gods
answered by petrifying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e414" href=
"#xd21e414" name="xd21e414">8</a>]</span>the animals, the screen and
the lump of salt, all of which are still visible round Kurunegala.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Panduvasa, the seventh king of Ceylon, was
visited by the tiger disease, a complicated malady of cough, asthma,
fever and diabetes in consequence of Wijeya, the first king, having
killed his old benefactor and discarded mistress, Kuv&ecirc;ni, when,
in the shape of a tiger, she endeavoured to revenge her slighted
charms. The gods taking pity on Panduvasa, consulted by what means he
might be restored to health, and found that it could not be effected
without the aid of one not born of a woman. The difficulty was to find
such a person. Rahu being sent on the service, discovered Malaya
Raj&acirc;, king of Malva D&ecirc;sa, the son of Vishnu, sprung from a
flower. Rahu changing himself into an immense boar, laid waste the
royal gardens to the great consternation of the gardeners, who fled to
the palace and told what was passing. The king, who was a keen
sportsman, hastened to the spot with his huntsmen, whom he ordered to
drive the boar towards him. The boar, when pressed, at one bound flew
over the head of the king, who shot an arrow through him in passing,
but without effect, the animal continuing his flight. The king,
irritated, instantly gave pursuit with his attendants in the direction
the beast had taken, and landed in Ceylon at Ur&acirc;tota (Hog ferry)
near Jaffna; the boar alighted near Attapitiya. A piece of sweet potato
that he brought from the garden in his mouth and which he here dropt
was immediately changed, it is said into a rock, that still preserves
its original form, and is still called Batalagala or sweet potato rock.
The king came up with the beast on the hill Hantana near Kandy,
instantly attacked him sword in hand, and with the first blow inflicted
a deep gash. On receiving this wound, the boar became transformed into
a rock which is now called Uragala, is very like a hog, and is said to
retain the mark of the wound. The king, whilst surprised and unable to
comprehend the meaning of the marvels he had just witnessed, received a
visit from Sakra, Vishnu and other gods who explained the mystery that
perplexed him, and the object in view in drawing him to Ceylon&mdash;he
alone, not being born of woman, having it in his power to break the
charm under which Panduvasa laboured. Malaya Raj&acirc; complying with
the wishes of the gods, ordered the Kohomba Yakku <span class="corr"
id="xd21e419" title="Source: danee">dance</span> to be performed which,
it is said, drove the sickness out of the king into a rock to the
northward of Kandy, which is still called the rock of the Tiger
sickness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e422src" href="#xd21e422"

<p class="par">&ldquo;The spirit of <span class="corr" id="xd21e427"
title="Source: Kuveni">Kuv&ecirc;ni</span> is still supposed to haunt
the country and inflict misfortune on the race of the conqueror by whom
she was betrayed. Kuvenigala is a bare mountain of rock on which are
two stones, one slightly resembling a human figure in a standing
attitude, the other looking like a seat. It is on this that traditions
assert, the Yakinni sometimes appears and casts the withering glance of
malignant power over the fair fields and fertile Valley of
Asgiriya&mdash;a sequestered and most romantic spot in the Matale
District.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e430src" href="#xd21e430"

<p class="par">Rocks with mystic marks indicate the spot where
treasures are concealed and lights are seen at night in such
places.</p>
<p class="par">When the owner of a treasure wanted to keep it safe, it
is said that he dug two holes in some lonely jungle and at night
proceeded to the spot with a servant carrying the treasure; after the
treasure was deposited in one hole, the master cut his servant&rsquo;s
throat and buried him in the other to make him a guardian of his
treasure in the form of a snake or demon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">The earth goddess (Mihi Ket) supports the world on one
of her thumbs and when weary shifts it on to the other causing an
earthquake.</p>
<p class="par">The four cardinal points are presided over by four
guardian deities (Hataravaran Deviy&ocirc;).</p>
<p class="par">Sea waves are three in number which follow each other in
regular succession. The first and the largest is the brother who fell
in love with his sister and who, to conquer his unholy passion,
committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The next is his mother who
jumped after her son, and the last and the smallest is the daughter
herself.</p>
<p class="par">The sky in the olden times was very close to the earth,
and the stars served as lamps to the people; a woman who was sweeping
her compound was so much troubled by the clouds touching her back when
she stooped to sweep that she gave the sky a blow with her ikle broom
saying &lsquo;get away&rsquo; (pala). The sky in shame immediately flew
out of the reach of man.</p>
<p class="par">The rainbow is the god Sakra&rsquo;s bow (Devidunne) and
portends fair weather; when any calamity is approaching Budures
(Buddha&rsquo;s rays) appear in the sky&mdash;&ldquo;a luminous
phenomenon consisting of horizontal bands of light which cross the sky
while the sun is in the ascendant.&rdquo; The twilight seen on hill
tops is the sunshine in which the female Rakshis dry their paddy.</p>
<p class="par">Lightning strikes the graves of cruel men; thunder
induces conception in female crocodiles and bursts open the
peahen&rsquo;s eggs.</p>
<p class="par">Children sing out to the moon &ldquo;<span lang=
"si-latn">Handahamy apatat bat kande ran tetiyak
diyo.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;(Mr. Moon do give us a golden plate in which
to eat our rice).</p>
<p class="par">When the new moon is first observed it is lucky to
immediately after look on rice, milk or kiss a kind and well to do
relative.</p>
<p class="par">The spots in the moon represent a hare to signify to the
world the self-sacrifice of Buddha in a previous existence.</p>
<p class="par">In each year the twelve days (Sankranti) on which the
sun moves from one sign of the zodiac to another, are considered
unlucky. There are twenty seven constellations (neket) which reach the
zenith at midnight on particular days in particular months; and their
position is ascertained from an astrologer before any work of
importance is begun.</p>
<p class="par">The sun, moon, and Rahu were three sons of a widowed
mother whom they left at home one day to attend a wedding. When they
returned she inquired what they had brought with them; the eldest
angrily replied that he had brought nothing, the second threw at her
the torch which had lighted them on the way, but the third asked for
his mother&rsquo;s rice pot and put into it a few grains of rice, which
he had brought concealed under his nails and which miraculously filled
the vessel. The mother&rsquo;s blessing made the youngest son the
pleasant and cool moon, while her curses made the second the burning
sun and the eldest the demon Rahu who tries to destroy his brothers by
swallowing them and causing an Eclipse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">Trees which grow to a large size like the Nuga

burn <span class="corr" id="xd21e489" title=

tree he visits to it three or four days previously and asks the spirit
residing there to take its abode elsewhere; otherwise evil will befall
him.</p>
<p class="par">On the way to Adam&rsquo;s Peak there are to be found
sacred orchards where a person may enter and eat any quantity of fruit
but will not be able to find his way out if he tries to bring any with
him.</p>
<p class="par">The Bo tree is sacred to Buddha and is never cut down;
its leaves shiver in remembrance of the great enlightenment which took
place under it. His three predecessors in the Buddha
hood&mdash;Kassapa, Kon&acirc;gama, Kakusanda&mdash;attained
enlightenment under the <i>nuga</i>, <i>dimbul</i> and the
<i>sirisa</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The margosa tree is sacred to Pattini and the telambu
tree to Navaratna W&acirc;lli. Each lunar asterism is associated with a
particular tree.</p>
<p class="par">Homage is paid to an overlord by presenting him with a
roll of 40 betel leaves with the stalk ends towards the receiver.
Before the betel is chewed, its apex and a piece of the petiole of the
base are broken off as a cobra brought the leaf from the lower world
holding both ends in its mouth. It is also considered beneath
one&rsquo;s dignity to eat the base of the petiole.</p>
<p class="par">The flowering of a tala tree (<i lang="la">corypha
umbraculifera</i>) is inauspicious to the village. A cocoanut only
falls on a person who has incurred divine displeasure; it is lucky to
own a cocoanut tree with a double stem.</p>
<p class="par">A king cocoanut tree near the house brings bad luck to
the owner&rsquo;s sons. When a person dies or a child is born a
cocoanut blossom is hung over him.</p>
<p class="par">The person who plants an arekanut tree becomes subject
to nervousness. The woman who chews the scarred slice of an arekanut
becomes a widow. If a married woman eats a plantain which is attached
to another, she gets twins.</p>
<p class="par">An astrologer once told a king that a particular day and
hour were so auspicious that anything planted then would become a
useful tree. The king directed the astrologer&rsquo;s head to be
severed and planted and this grew into the crooked cocoanut tree.
Pleased with the result he got his own head severed and planted and it
grew into the straight areka tree.</p>
<p class="par">Red flowers (<i lang="si-latn">rat mal</i>) are sacred
to malignant spirits and white flowers (<i>sudu mal</i>) to beneficient
spirits. Turmeric water is used for charming and sticks from bitter
plants are used as magic wands. The N&acirc;ga darana root (<i lang=
"la">martynia diandra</i>) protects a man from snake bite.</p>
<p class="par">It is auspicious to have growing near houses the

rasping sensation in the throat when they are named within the

fertility of the soil; where diyataliya (<i lang="la">mexitixia

flourish a copious supply of water can be obtained.</p>
<p class="par">The bark of the bo tree and of the B&ocirc;mbu (<i lang=
"la">symplocos spicata</i>) prevent the contagion of sore eyes when
tied on the arms.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning the only food used by man was an edible
fungus like boiled milk which grew spontaneously upon the earth. As man
fell from his primitive simplicity this substance disappeared and rice
without the husk took its place. But when man became depraved the rice
developed a covering and ceased to grow spontaneously forcing men to
work.</p>
<p class="par">A poor widow had a daughter who married a rich man. One
day she went to her daughter&rsquo;s and asked for a little rice to
eat. Though the pot of rice was on the fire, the daughter said she had
none to give and the mother went away. The daughter found the rice in
the pot had turned into blood and she threw it away. The god Sakraya in
revenge reduced the daughter to beggary and the mother and daughter on
the god&rsquo;s advice dug where the pot of rice had been emptied and
found the batala yam (bata rice and l&ecirc;-blood). Thereafter the
batala (<i lang="la">Edulis batatas</i>) became the food of the
poor.</p>
<p class="par">That the jak fruit may be eaten by the people, the god
Sakray&acirc; came to earth as a Brahmin, plucked a fruit and asked a
woman to cook it without tasting. The smell was so tempting that she
stealthily ate a little of it and was called a thievish woman (hera,
thief; and liya woman.) The fruit is consequently called heraliya.</p>
<p class="par">A king once directed a jeweller to work in gold a design
similar to the club moss; the goldsmith found this so hard that he went
mad and the moss is called the jeweller&rsquo;s curse (<i lang=
"si-latn">badal vanassa</i>).</p>
<p class="par">The butterfly orchid inflames one&rsquo;s passion and is
called the &ldquo;yam that killed the younger sister&rdquo; (<i lang=
"si-latn">nag&acirc; meru ale</i>) as a sister once accidentally tasted
it and made amorous gestures to her brother who killed her.</p>
<p class="par">If a person approaches the mythical Damba tree without a
charm he will be killed. The celestial Kapruka gives everything one
wishes for. The unknown Visakumbha is an antidote for poison and is
eaten by the mungoose after its fight with the cobra. Kusa grass
(sevendr&acirc;) exists both on earth and in heaven.</p>
<p class="par">The imaginary Kalu nika twig floats against the current,
cuts in two the strongest metal; when eaten rejuvenates the old; and to
obtain it the young of the etikukul&acirc; (jungle fowl) should be tied

will be soon deserted. Medicinal virtues are ascribed to the flesh of
monkeys. To look at a slender loris (una hapuluva) brings ill luck and
its eyes are used for a love potion. The lion&rsquo;s fat corrodes any
vessel except one of gold; its roar which makes one deaf is raised
three times&mdash;first when it starts from its den, next when it is
well on its way, and last when it springs on its victim. It kills
elephants but eats only their brain. The unicorn (<i lang=

pierces the rocks that impede its progress.</p>
<p class="par">If a dog howls or scratches away the earth before a

himself.</p>
<p class="par">A cheetah likes the warmth of a blaze and comes near the
cultivator&rsquo;s watch fire in the field, calls him by name and
devours him; it frequents where peacocks abound; it does not eat the
victim that falls with the right side uppermost. Small pox patients are
carried away by this animal which is attracted by the offensive smell
they emanate; when the cheetah gets a sore mouth by eating the wild
herb <i lang="si-latn">m&icirc;manadandu</i>, it swallows lumps of clay
to allay its hunger; its skin and claws are used as amulets; the female
cheetah gives birth only once and has no subsequent intercourse with
her mate owing to the severe travail; the cheetah was taught by the cat
to climb up a tree but not to climb down; in revenge it always kills
its tutor but is reverent enough not to make a meal of the body which
it places on an elevated spot and worships. One in a thousand cheetahs
has the jaya-revula (lucky side whiskers) which never fails to bring
good fortune if worn as an amulet.</p>

caterwauling is unlucky. The grey mungoose bites as an antidote a plant
not identified called visakumbha before and after its fight with the

mouth of a tired bull is rubbed on its body to relieve its fatigue, and
bezoar stones (<i lang="si-latn">g&ocirc;r&ocirc;chana</i>) found in
cattle are prescribed for small pox. In the olden time the ox had no
horns but had teeth in both its jaws, while the horse had horns but had
no teeth in its upper jaw; each coveted the other&rsquo;s possessions
and effected an exchange; the ox taking the horns and giving the horse
its upper row of teeth; cart bulls are driven with the words

bloodsuckers may be lurking there to creep inside its trunk. A dead
elephant is never found for when death approaches the elephant goes to
a secluded spot and lays itself down to die. Children who are made to
pass under an elephant&rsquo;s body become strong and are free from
illness.</p>

<p class="par">A shower during sunshine denotes the jackal&rsquo;s
wedding day; a jackal always joins the cry of its friends, otherwise
its hair will drop off one by one; a jackal&rsquo;s horn (<i lang=

everything he wishes for and when buried in a threshing floor increases
the crop, a hundred fold. The jackals assisted by the denizens of the
woods once waged war against the wild fowls (<i lang=
"si-latn">welikukul&ocirc;</i>) who called to their aid a party of men
one of whom seized the king of the jackals and dashed him on a rock and
broke his jaw; as the king received the blow he raised the cry, apoi
mage hakka (Oh my jaw), which could still be heard in the
jackal&rsquo;s howl. The wild fowls are still the enemies of the
jackals. The jackals and the crabs have also a feud between them; a
jackal once deceived a crocodile on the promise of getting the latter a
wife and got himself ferried across the river for several days till he
had consumed the carcase of the elephant on the other bank. A crab
undertook to assist the crocodile to take revenge, invited the jackal
to a feast and suggested to him to go to the riverside for a drink of
water. The jackal consented but on seeing his enemy lying in wait
killed the crab for his treachery. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the black bird bring ill luck and are chased away from the vicinity of
houses. The cry of the night heron (kana-koka) as it flies over a house
presages illness and that of the devil bird (ulam&acirc;) death. The

<p class="par">Crows are divided into two castes which do not mate, the
hooded crows and the jungle crows; they faint three times at night
through hunger and their insatiate appetite can only be temporarily
appeased by making them swallow rags dipped in ghee; they hatch their
eggs in time to take their young to the Ehela festival held in honour
of the godlings during July and August. A crow seldom dies a natural
death, and once in a hundred years a feather drops. As no one eats its
flesh it sorrowfully cries k&acirc;tka (I eat every body). The king
crow was once a barber and it now pecks its dishonest debtor, the

<p class="par">The presence of sparrows in a house indicates that a
male child will be born and when they play in the sand that there will

be seen on the cock sparrow.</p>
<p class="par">A house will be temporarily abandoned if a spotted dove

(<i lang="la">bassia longifolia</i>) and asked her little son to watch
them; when they were parched they got stuck to the ground and could not
be seen; the mother thought the child had been negligent and killed him
in anger; a shower of rain which fell just then showed to her the lost
herbs and in remorse she killed herself and was born the spotted dove,
who still laments. &ldquo;I got back my m&icirc; flowers but not my

swan king&rsquo;s daughter and when going to solicit her hand borrowed
the pitta&rsquo;s beautiful tail which he refused to return after

which they keep out to entice insects; they kill themselves if this be
taken from them which can be done by getting on to a tree and throwing
cowdung over the gem. Cobras are fond of sandal wood and the sweet

after twelve months it enters the house and makes its presence felt by
emitting offensive smells and contaminating food as a <i lang=
"si-latn">Peretay&acirc;</i> or by destroying the pots and plates of
the house and pelting stones as a <i lang="si-latn">gevalay&acirc;</i>
or by apparitions as an <i lang="si-latn">avat&acirc;r&eacute;</i> or
by creating strange sounds as a <i lang="si-latn">holmana</i>; it is
afraid of iron and lime and when over boisterous a kattadiya rids it
from the house by nailing it to a tree, or enclosing it in a small
receptacle and throwing it into the sea where it is so confined till
some one unwittingly sets it free when it recommences its tricks with
double force. A woman who dies in parturition and is buried with the
child becomes a <i lang="si-latn">bodirima</i>; she is short and fat,
rolls like a cask, kills men whenever she can; if a lamp and some betel
leaves be kept where she haunts she will be seen heating a leaf and
warming her side; the women chase her away with threats of beating her
with an ikle broom; if shot at she turns into a chameleon (yak
katuss&acirc;). If a person dreams of a dead relative he gives food to
a beggar the next morning. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1021"

<h2 class="main"><i>SUPERHUMAN BEINGS.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The three sources of superhuman influence from
which the Singhalese peasantry expect good or ill are (1) the spirits
of disease and poverty; (2) tutelary spirits of various grades and (3)
the planetary spirits.</p>
<p class="par">There are several important spirits of disease such as
Maha Sohona, Riri Yak&acirc;, Kalu Kum&acirc;ra Yak&acirc;, Sanni
Yak&acirc;.</p>
<p class="par">Maha Sohona is 122 feet high, has the head of a bear
with a pike in his left hand and in his right an elephant, whose blood
he squeezes out to drink; he inflicts cholera and dysentery and
presides over graveyards and where three roads meet and rides on a pig.
In ancient times two giants Jayasena and Gotimbara met in single
combat; the latter knocked off the head of Jayasena when the god
Senasur&acirc; tore off the head of a bear and placed it on
Jayasena&rsquo;s body who rose up alive as the demon Maha Sohona.</p>
<p class="par">Riri Yak&acirc; has a monkey face, carries in one hand a
cock and a club in the other with a corpse in his mouth, is present at
every death bed, haunts fields and causes fever flux of blood and loss
of appetite, and has a crown of fire on his head. He came into the
world from the womb of his mother by tearing himself through her
heart.</p>
<p class="par">Kalu Kum&acirc;ra Yak&acirc; is a young devil of a dark
complexion who is seen embracing a woman; he prevents conception,
delays childbirth and causes puerperal madness. He was a Buddhist arhat
with the supernatural power of going through the air. In one of his
aerial travels, he saw a beautiful princess and falling in love with
her lost at once his superhuman powers and dropped down dead and became
the demon Kalu Kum&acirc;ra Yak&acirc;.</p>
<p class="par">Sanni Yak&acirc; has cobras twisting round his body with
a pot of fire near him, holds a rosary in his hand, causes different
forms of coma, rides on a horse or lion, has 18 incarnations and forms
a trinity with Oddi Yak&acirc; and Huniam Yak&acirc;. He was the son of
a queen put to death by her husband who suspected she was unfaithful to
his bed. As the queen who was pregnant was being executed, she said
that if the charge was false the child in her womb will become a demon
and destroy the King and his city. Her corpse gave birth to the Sanni
Yak&acirc; who inflicted a mortal disease on his father and depopulated
the country.</p>
<p class="par">When any of these demons has afflicted a person the
prescribed form of exorcism is a devil dance. In the patient&rsquo;s
garden, a space of about 30 square feet is marked out (<i lang=
"si-latn">atamagala</i>) and bounded with lemon sticks. Within the
enclosure, raised about 3 feet from the ground, is erected an altar
(<i lang="si-latn">samema</i>) for the offerings (<i lang=
"si-latn">pidenitatu</i>). The shape of the altar depends on the
afflicting demon&mdash;triangular for Riri Yak&acirc;, rectangular for
Sanni Yak&acirc;, semicircular for Kalu Kum&acirc;ra Yak&acirc; and
square for Maha Sohona.</p>
<p class="par">The offerings consist of boiled rice, a roasted egg,
seven kinds of curries, five kinds of roasted seed, nine kinds of
flowers, betel leaves, fried grain, powdered resin and a thread spun by
a virgin. There are the usual tom tom beaters; and the exorcist and his
assistants are dressed in white and red jackets, with crown shaped head
ornaments, and bell attached leglets and armlets, and carrying torches
and incense pans.</p>
<p class="par">The ceremony consists of a series of brisk dances by the
exorcist, and his men, at times masked, in the presence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1055" href="#xd21e1055" name=
"xd21e1055">22</a>]</span>of the patient to the accompaniment of a
chant (<i lang="si-latn">kavi</i>) giving the life history of the
devil, with a whirling of the blazing torches. This lasts from evening
till dawn when the exorcist lies on his back and calls on the devil to
cure the patient (<i lang="si-latn">y&acirc;dinna</i>); incantations
follow (<i lang="si-latn">mantra</i>), and the sacrifices are offered.
For the Riri Yak&acirc; a cock which had been placed under the altar or
tied to the foot of the patient is killed and thrown into the jungle;
for the Kalu Yak&acirc; an <span class="corr" id="xd21e1066" title=
"Source: earthern">earthen</span> pot which had been placed on the
altar is broken; for the Sanni Yak&acirc; the offerings are conveyed in
a large bag to a stream or river and thrown into the water; for the
Maha Sohona the exorcist feigns himself dead to deceive the devil and
is carried with mock lamentations to a burial ground.</p>
<p class="par">The spirits of poverty&mdash;Gar&acirc; Yakku&mdash;are
twelve in number <i>viz.</i>, (1) Molan Garavva; (2) Dala
R&acirc;kshay&acirc;, (3) Yama R&acirc;kshay&acirc;; (4)
P&ucirc;ranik&acirc;; (5) Ratnak&ucirc;tay&acirc;; (6) N&icirc;la Giri;
(7) Nanda Giri; (8) Chandra K&acirc;v&acirc;; (9) M&acirc;rak&acirc;;
(10) Asuraya; (11) N&acirc;tagiri; (12) Pelmadull&acirc;. They haunt
every nook and corner of a house, destroy crops, make trees barren, new
houses inauspicious, send pests of flies and insects, reduce families
to abject poverty, and are propitiated by a dance called Gar&acirc;
Yakuma. A shed (<i lang="si-latn">maduva</i>) is put up for it and
round it is a narrow altar, with a platform in front (<i lang=
"si-latn">wesatte</i>). On the altar are placed four kinds of flowers,
betel leaves, some cotton, a spindle, a cotton cleaner, a shuttle, a
comb, a little hair, a looking glass, a bundle of gurulla leaves, two
burning torches and a few cents. Men of the Oli caste dressed in white
and red and at times masked dance from evening till morning within the
shed and on the platform. Late at night an oblation is made in
leaf-cups of seven different vegetables cooked in one utensil, boiled
rice, cakes and plantains. At day break the dancers stretch themselves
on the ground and receive nine pecuniary offerings; they then rise up
and conclude the ceremony by striking the roof of the shed with a rice
pounder.</p>
<p class="par">The tutelary deities are of three grades <i>viz.</i>,
(1) Gods; (2) Godlings and (3) Divine Mothers. The Gods are Maha
Deviy&ocirc;; Natha Deviy&ocirc;; Saman Deviy&ocirc;; Kateragama
Deviy&ocirc;; and the Goddess Pattini.</p>
<p class="par">Maha Deviy&ocirc; is identified with Vishnu, and is the
guardian deity of the island, and is a candidate for the <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1088" title="Source: Buddahood">Buddhahood</span>; a
miniature weapon in gold or silver is placed at his shrine as a votive
offering.</p>
<p class="par">Natha Deviy&ocirc; is the future Maitri Buddha and is
now biding his time in the Tusita heaven; Kandyan sovereigns at their
coronation girt their swords and adopted their kingly title before his
shrine.</p>
<p class="par">Saman Deviy&ocirc; is the deified half brother of Rama,
who conquered Ceylon in prehistoric times, and is the guardian spirit
of Adam&rsquo;s Peak; pilgrims while climbing the sacred hill to
worship Buddha&rsquo;s foot-print, call on him to aid their ascent. A
miniature elephant in gold or silver is the usual votive offering to
him.</p>
<p class="par">Kateragama Deviy&ocirc; is the most popular of the gods;
a prehistoric deity, to whom a miniature peacock in gold or silver is
the customary, votive offering. He is said to be the six faced and
twelve handed god Kandaswamy who on his homeward return to
Kail&acirc;sa after defeating the Asuras halted at Kataragama in South
Ceylon; here he met his consort Valli Amm&acirc; whom he wooed in the
guise of a mendicant; when his advances were scornfully rejected, his
brother assuming the head of a man and the body of an elephant appeared
on the scene and the terrified maiden rushed into her suitor&rsquo;s
arms for safety; the god then revealed himself and she became his
bride. The god Ayiyan&acirc;r invoked in the forests of Ceylon is said
to be his half brother.</p>
<p class="par">Pattini is the goddess of chastity.</p>
<p class="par">The three eyed P&acirc;ndi Raja of Madura had subjugated
the gods <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1101" href="#xd21e1101"
name="xd21e1101">23</a>]</span>and was getting them to dig a pond near
his royal city when, at Sakraya&rsquo;s request, Pattini who resided in
Avaragiri Parvata became conceived in a mango fruit. After it was
severed from the tree by an arrow of Sakraya, it remain suspended in
the air and on P&acirc;ndi R&acirc;ja looking up to observe the wonder,
a drop of juice fell on the third eye in the middle of his forehead by
which he lost his power and the gods were liberated. Pattini was found
inside the mango as an infant of exquisite beauty sucking her
thumb<span class="corr" id="xd21e1103" title="Source: when">.
When</span> she grew up she performed wonders and ultimately
disappeared within a Kohomba tree (<i>margosa</i>). An armlet or a
miniature mango fruit in gold or silver is placed at her devala as a
votive offering.</p>
<p class="par">These deities are worshipped in separate dev&acirc;la
which are in charge of Kapur&acirc;las who have to bathe daily and
anoint themselves with lime juice, avoid drinking spirits and eating
flesh, eggs, turtle or eel and keep away from houses where a birth or
death has taken place. A dewala consists of two rooms, one being the
sanctum for the insignia of the god&mdash;a spear, bill hook or
arrow&mdash;and the other being the ante room for the musicians;
attached to the devala is the multeng&ecirc; (kitchen). On Wednesdays
and Saturdays the doors of the dewala are opened; the Multeng&ecirc;
Kapur&acirc;la cooks the food for the deity; the Tev&acirc;va
Kapural&acirc; offers it at the shrine on a plantain leaf enclosed with
areka-flower-strips, and purified with saffron water, sandal paste and
incense. Before and after the meal is offered, drums are beaten in the
ante room. In return for offerings made by votaries the
Anumetir&acirc;la invokes the god to give relief from any ailment, a
plentiful harvest, thriving cattle, success in litigation, and children
to sterile mothers. Punishment to a faithless wife, curses on a
forsworn enemy and vengeance on a thief are invoked by getting the
Kapur&acirc;la to break a p&ucirc;n&acirc; kale&mdash;a pot with mystic
designs,&mdash;or to throw into the sea or a river a charmed mixture of
powdered condiments. Once a year, when the agricultural season begins,
between July and August, the in-signia of the gods are carried on
elephants in procession through the streets accompanied by musicians,
dancers, temple tenants and custodians of the shrine. The festival
begins on a new moon day and lasts till the full moon when the
procession proceeds to a neighbouring river or stream where the
Kapur&acirc;la cuts the water with a sword and removes a potful of it
and keeps it in the dewala till it is emptied into the same stream the
following year and another potful taken.</p>
<p class="par">The well-known godlings are (1) Wahala Band&acirc;ra
Deviy&ocirc; <i>alias</i> D&ecirc;vat&acirc; Band&acirc;ra; (2)
Wir&acirc;munda Deviy&ocirc;; (3) Wanniya Band&acirc;ra; (4) Kirti
Band&acirc;ra; (5) Menik Band&acirc;ra; (6) Mangala Deviy&ocirc;; (7)
Kum&acirc;ra Deviy&ocirc;; (8) Irugal Band&acirc;ra; (9) Kalu
Vedd&acirc; <i>alias</i> Kalu Band&acirc;ra; (10) Gang&ecirc;
Band&acirc;ra; (11) Devol Deviy&ocirc;; (12) Iland&acirc;ri
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1119" title=

Monar&acirc;vila Alut Deviy&ocirc;; (15) Gal&ecirc; Deviy&ocirc;; (16)
Ayiyanar Deviy&ocirc;.</p>
<p class="par">The godlings are local; those which are worshipped in
one country district are not sometimes known in another. Their insignia
together with a few peacock feathers are sometimes kept in small
detached buildings called kovil with representations of the godlings
rudely drawn on the walls. A priest called a Yakdessa is in charge of a
kovil and when people fall ill &ldquo;they send for the Yakdessa to
their house, and give him a red cock chicken, which he takes up in his
hand, and holds an arrow with it, and dedicates it to the god, by
telling him, that if he restore the party to his health, that cock is
given to him, and shall be dressed and sacrificed to him in his kovil.
They then let the cock go among the rest of the poultry, and keep it
afterwards, it may be, a year or two; and then they carry it to the
temple, or the priest comes for it: for sometimes he will go round
about, and fetch a great many cocks together that have been dedicated,
telling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1124" href="#xd21e1124"
name="xd21e1124">24</a>]</span>the owners that he must make a sacrifice
to the god; though, it may be, when he hath them, he will go to some
other place and convert them into money for his own use, as I myself
can witness; we could buy three of them for four-pence half penny. When
the people are minded to inquire any thing of their gods, the priests
take up some of the arms and instruments of the gods, that are in the
temples upon his shoulder; and then he either feigns himself to be mad,
or really is so, which the people call pissuvetichchi; and then the
spirit of the gods is in him, and whatsoever he pronounceth is looked
upon as spoken by God himself, and the people will speak to him as if
it were the very person of God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1126src" href="#xd21e1126" name="xd21e1126src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">Gal&ecirc; Deviy&ocirc; or Gal&ecirc; Band&acirc;ra,
also called Malala Band&acirc;ra is the god of the rock and is
propitiated in parts of the Eastern Province, Uva and the Kurunegalle
district, to avert sickness, bad luck and drought. &ldquo;In these
districts, in all cases, the dance, which is a very important part of
the proceedings, and indispensable in the complete ceremony, takes
place on a high projecting crag near the top of a prominent hill or on
the summit of the hill, if it is a single bare rock. On this wild and
often extremely dangerous platform, on some hills a mere pinnacle
usually hundreds of feet above the plain below, the Anumetir&acirc;la
performs his strange dance, like that of all so called devil dancers.
He chants no song in honour of the ancient deity but postures in
silence with bent knees and waving arms, holding up the bill
hooks&mdash;the god himself for the time being. When he begins to feel
exhausted the performer brings the dance to an end, but sometimes his
excitement makes it necessary for his assistant to seize him and
forcibly compel him to stop. He then descends from his dizzy post,
assisted by his henchmen, and returns to the dev&acirc;la with the tom
toms and the crowd.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1132src" href=
"#xd21e1132" name="xd21e1132src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">The spirits of the forest, invoked by pilgrims and
hunters are Wanniy&acirc; Band&acirc;ra, Mangala Deviy&ocirc;,
Iland&acirc;ri Deviy&ocirc; and Kalu Band&acirc;ra <i>alias</i> Kalu
Vedd&acirc;. Kaluwedda is a demon supposed to possess power over the
animal race. &ldquo;When a person, more commonly a public hunter,
shoots an animal, whether small or large, he, without uttering a single
word, takes on the spot three drops of blood from the wound, and
smearing them on three leaves makes them into the shape of a cup, and
offers them on the branches of a tree, clapping his hands, and
expressing words to this effect, &ldquo;Friend Kaluwedda, give ear to
my words: come upon the branches, and receive the offering I give to
thee!&rdquo; The effect of this superstition is supposed to be, that
the hunter will seldom or never miss his game.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1140src" href="#xd21e1140" name="xd21e1140src">3</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Manik Band&acirc;ra is the spirit of gem pits and Gange
Band&acirc;ra is the spirit of streams and rivers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The malignant spirit called Gange Band&acirc;ra,
Oya Band&acirc;ra, Oya Yakka, etc. is properly an object of terror, not
of worship; and under very many different appellations the identity is
easily perceived: he is the representative or personification of those
severe fevers, to which, from some occult causes, the banks of all
Ceylon rivers are peculiarly liable. The manner of making offerings to
the Gange Band&acirc;ra is by forming a miniature double canoe,
ornamented with cocoanut leaves so as to form a canopy: under this are
placed betel, rice, flowers, and such like articles of small value to
the donor, as he flatters himself may be acceptable to the fiend, and
induce him to spare those who acknowledge his power. After performing
certain ceremonies, this propitiatory float is launched upon the
nearest river, in a sickly season. I have seen many of these delicate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1150" href="#xd21e1150" name=
"xd21e1150">25</a>]</span>arks whirling down the streams, or aground on
the sand banks and fords of the Ambanganga (Matale
East).&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1152src" href="#xd21e1152"
name="xd21e1152src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">Ayiyannar Deviy&ocirc; is the god of tanks and he is
propitiated under a tree by the bund of a tank, by throwing up in the
air boiled milk in a hot state. Sundara Band&acirc;ra extends his
protection to those who invoke him before sleeping.</p>
<p class="par">W&icirc;ramunda Deviy&ocirc; is a spirit of agriculture
and rice cakes made of the new paddy is offered to the godling on a
platform on which are placed husked cocoanuts, flowers, plantains, a
lighted lamp, a pestle and a mortar. Gopalla is a pastoral godling who
torments cattle at night and afflicts them with murrain. Devol
Deviy&ocirc; is a South Indian deity who came to Ceylon in spite of the
attempts to stop him by Pattini who placed blazing fires in his way.
Masked dances of a special kind involving walking over fire take place
in his honour. Kirti Bandara, and Monaravila Alut Deviy&ocirc; are two
lately deified chieftains, the former lived in the reign of king Kirti
Siri (1747&ndash;1780), the latter is Keppitipola who was beheaded by
the British in 1818.</p>
<p class="par">Wahala Bandara <span class="corr" id="xd21e1164" title=
"Source: Deviyo">Deviy&ocirc;</span> <i>alias</i> Devat&acirc; Bandara
is a minister of Vishnu and is invoked when demon-possessed patients
cannot be cured by the ordinary devil dance. At his dev&acirc;la in
Alut Nuwera, 11 miles from Kandy, the Kapur&acirc;la beats the patient
with canes till the devil is exorcised. With him is associated Malwatte
Band&acirc;ra, another minister of Vishnu.</p>
<p class="par">The peace of the home is impersonated in seven divine
mothers who are said to be manifestations of the goddess Pattini. Their
names vary according to the different localities. They are known in
some places as:&mdash;(1) Miriyabedde Kiri Amma or Bedd&ecirc; Mehelli;
(2) Pudmar&acirc;ga Kiri Amma (3) Un&acirc;p&acirc;na Kiri Amma; (4)
Kosgama Kiri Amma; (5) B&acirc;la Kiri Amma; (6) B&ocirc;valagedere
Kiri Amma; (7) Indigolleve Kiri Amma.</p>
<p class="par">Navaratna Valli is the patroness of the Rodiyas and is
said to have been born from the Telambu tree. Henakanda Bis&ocirc;
Band&acirc;ra was born of a wood apple and is invoked as the wife of
Devat&acirc; Band&acirc;ra.</p>
<p class="par">A thank offering is made to the divine mothers when
children are fretful, when a family recovers from chicken pox or some
kindred disease, when a mother has had an easy confinement. Seven
married women are invited to represent them and are offered a meal of
rice, rice cakes, milk, fruits and vegetables; before eating they
purify themselves with turmeric water and margosa leaves; a lamp with
seven wicks in honour of the seven divine mothers are kept where they
are served; after the repast they severally blow out a wick by clapping
their hands and take away what is left of the repast. Before a house is
newly occupied the seven divine mothers are invoked by ceremoniously
boiling rice in milk; a fire is made in the main room and over it is
kept a new pot full of milk resting on three green sticks placed like a
tripod. As the milk begins to boil pounded rice is put into it. The
person superintending the cooking wears a white cloth over his mouth.
Seven married women are first served with the cooked milk-rice on
plantain leaves, and afterwards the others present.</p>
<p class="par">The mystery of the jungle is impersonated in the
Bedd&ecirc; Mehelli.</p>
<p class="par">After a successful harvest or to avert an epidemic from
the village a ceremonial dance (<i lang="si-latn">gammadu</i>) for
which the peasantry subscribe takes place for seven days in honour of
the gods, godlings and divine mothers. A temporary building, open on
all sides, and decorated with flowers and fruits is erected on the
village green, and a branch of the Jak <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

cut ceremonially by the celebrant and carried into the building and
placed on the east side as a dedicatory post with a little boiled rice,
a cocoanut flower, two cocoanuts and a lamp. Altars are erected for the
various deities and on these the celebrant places with music, chant and
dance their respective insignia, all present making obeisance. Water
mixed with saffron is sprinkled on the floor, resin is burnt and a
series of dances and mimetic representations of the life history of the
deities take place every night. On the last day there is a ceremonial
boiling of rice in milk and a general feast.</p>

<p class="par first">One will not start on a journey, if he meets as he
gets out a beggar, a Buddhist priest, a person carrying firewood or his
implements of labour, if a lizard chirps, a dog sneezes or flaps his
ears. Nor will he turn back after once setting out; if he has forgotten
anything it is sent after him, he never returns for it. That the object
of his journey may be prosperous he starts with the right foot foremost
at an auspicious moment, generally at dawn, when the cock crows; his
hopes are at their highest if he sees on the way a milch cow, cattle, a
pregnant woman or a person carrying a pitcher full of water, flowers or
fruits.</p>
<p class="par">Thieves will not get out when there is the handa madala
(ring round the moon) as they will be arrested.</p>
<p class="par">The day&rsquo;s luck or ill-luck depends on what one
sees the first thing in the morning; if anything unlucky be done on a
Monday, it will continue the whole week.</p>
<p class="par">If a crow caws near one&rsquo;s house in the morning, it
forebodes sickness or death, at noon pleasure or the arrival of a
friend, and in the evening profit; if it drops its excrement on the
head, shoulders or on the back of a person it signifies happiness but
on the knee or in step a speedy death.</p>
<p class="par">A lizard warns by its chirp; if it chirps from the East
pleasant news can be expected, from the South news of sickness or
death, from the North profit and from the West the arrival of a friend.
If a lizard or a skink (<i lang="si-latn">hikenell&acirc;</i>) falls on
the right side of a person, he will gain riches, if on the left he will
meet with ill luck.</p>
<p class="par">A snake doctor finds out what kind of reptile had bitten
a person by a queer method; if the person who comes to fetch him
touches his breast with the right hand it is a viper; if the head it is
a mapila; if the stomach a frog; if the right shoulder with the left
hand a karaval&acirc;, (<i lang="la">bungarus coerulus</i>); if he be
excited a skink; and if the messenger be a weeping female carrying a
child it is a cobra.</p>
<p class="par">Something similar to crystal gazing is attempted by
means of a betel leaf smeared with a magical oil; a female deity
(Anjanan Devi) appears on the leaf and reveals what the gazer
seeks.</p>
<p class="par">A professional fortune teller (guru) when a client comes
to consult him, measures the client&rsquo;s shadow, divides it into
three equal parts and after some calculations informs him whether a
lost article will be found, a sick person will recover or any
enterprise will fail or succeed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">Dreams that prognosticate a good future are kept secret,
but bad ones are published. When a bad dream is dreamt it is advisable
to go to a lime tree early in the morning, mention the dream and ask
the tree to take to itself all the bad effects. Dreams at the first
watch of the night will be accomplished in a year, at the second watch
in eight months, at the third watch in five months, and at the dawn of
day in ten days.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of riding on a bull or an elephant,
ascending the summit of a mountain, entering a palace, or smearing
himself with excrement he will obtain an increase of wealth.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams that his right hand was bitten by a
white serpent he will obtain riches at the end of ten days.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of a crane, a domestic fowl, an eagle
or crows, he will get an indulgent wife.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of the sun or moon, he will be
restored from sickness.</p>
<p class="par">If the teeth of an individual in his dream fall out or
shake his wealth will be ruined or he will lose a child or parent but
if his hands be chained or bound together he will have a son or obtain
a favour.</p>
<p class="par">If a female clothed in black embraces a man in his dream
it foretells death.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of an extensive field ripe for the
sickle, he will obtain rice paddy within ten days.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of an owl, a beast in rut or being
burnt he will lose his habitation.</p>
<p class="par">If a person dreams of nymphs dancing, laughing, running
or clapping their hands, he will have to leave his native land.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>THE MAGIC ART.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Words of Power called Mantra are committed to
memory and used for various purposes. Jugglers utter them to raise a
magic veil over the eyes of the spectators, and sorcerers to detect
thefts, to induce love, to remove spells to cure possession and to
inflict disease or death.</p>
<p class="par">Mantra are uttered to keep away animals. Elephants are
frightened by &ldquo;<span lang="si-latn">Om sri j&acirc;t&acirc;
h&acirc;r&ecirc; bh&acirc;vatu arahan situ.</span>&rdquo; A dog takes
to its heels when the following is muttered thrice over the hand and
stretched towards it &ldquo;<span lang="si-latn">Om nam&ocirc;
budung&ecirc; p&acirc;v&acirc;d&ecirc; bat k&acirc;pu ball&acirc; kikki
kukk&acirc; nam t&ocirc; situ. Om buddha namas saka
situ</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As a preventive against harmful influences, a thread
spun by a virgin, and rubbed with turmeric is charmed over charcoal and
resin-smoke and tied round one&rsquo;s arm<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1339" title="Not in source">,</span> waist or neck, having as
many knots as the number of the times the charm has been repeated.</p>
<p class="par">Amulets (yantra) made of five kinds of metal (gold,
silver, copper, brass, iron) are similarly worn for avoiding evil and
these are either pentacle shaped, crescent shaped or cylindrical
enclosing a charmed ola leaf, charmed oil or charmed pills.</p>
<p class="par">To win a girl&rsquo;s affections the lover has only to
rub a charmed vegetable paste over his face and show himself to the
girl, or give her to eat a charmed preparation of peacock&rsquo;s
liver, honey and herbs or make her chew a charmed betel leaf, or
sprinkle on her some charmed oil, or wear a charmed thread taken from
her dress.</p>
<p class="par">To detect a theft, a cocoanut is charmed, attached to a
stick and placed where a thief has made his escape, and while the
operator holds it he is led along to the thief&rsquo;s house. Persons
suspected of theft are made to stand with bared backs round an ash
plantain tree and as it is struck with a charmed creeper, the culprit
gets an ashy streak on his back. They are also asked to touch a charmed
fowl in turn and the fowl begins to crow as soon as the thief touches
its body. The names of the suspected persons are sometimes written on
slips of paper and placed on the ground with a cowrie shell opposite
each slip, and as soon as the mantra is uttered the shell opposite the
thief&rsquo;s name begins to move.</p>
<p class="par">Charmed branches are hung up by hunters and wayfarers
near dangerous spots. If charmed slaked lime be secretly rubbed on the
lintel of a man&rsquo;s house before he starts out shooting, he will
not kill any bird, and if rubbed on the threshold he will not kill any
fourfooted animal.</p>
<p class="par">A person under the influence of a charm is taken to a
banyan tree with his hair wrapped round the head of a cock; the hair is
cut off with a mantra, the bird nailed to the tree and the patient
cured.</p>
<p class="par">The charm known as Pilli is used to inflict immediate
death; the sorcerer procures a dead body of a child, animal, bird,
reptile <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1354" href="#xd21e1354"
name="xd21e1354">30</a>]</span>or insect and goes at dawn, noon or
midnight to a lonely spot where three roads meet or to a grave yard and
lying on his back utters a mantra; the dead body becomes animated and
it is given the name of the intended victim with directions to inflict
on him a fatal wound: to stab, strangle, bite or sting him.</p>
<p class="par">The charm called Angama causes the victim to throw up
blood and it affects within seven hours; the sorcerer takes some
article that the intended victim had worn or touched, goes to a lonely
spot, charms it and touches the victim, or fans him with it or
stretches it towards him, or keeps it in the hand and looks at his face
or blows so that the breath may light on him or leaves it in some
accessible place that it may be picked up by him.</p>
<p class="par">The charm known as the Huniama is frequently practised
and it takes effect within intervals varying from a day to several
years; the sorcerer makes an image to represent the intended victim;
nails made of five kinds of metal are fixed at each joint, and the
victim&rsquo;s name written on a leaf, or a lock of his hair, or a nail
paring, or a thread from his dress inserted in its body; the image is
charmed and buried where the victim has to pass and if he does so, he
falls ill with swelling, with stiffness of joints, with a burning
sensation in his body or with paralysis.</p>
<p class="par">A Pilli or Angama charm can be warded off if the victim
himself be a sorcerer when by a counter charm he can direct the
operator himself to be killed or injured.</p>
<p class="par">A Huniama charm can be nullified by getting a sorcerer
either to cut some charmed lime fruits which have come in contact with
the patient or to slit with an arekanut cutter a charmed coil of
creepers placed round the patient&rsquo;s neck, shoulders and anklets
or to keep a charmed pumpkin gourd on the sorcerer&rsquo;s chest while
lying on his back and making the patient cut it in two with a bill
hook, the parts being thrown into the sea or a stream; or to break up a
charmed waxen figure and throw the pieces into boiling oil.

<h2 class="main"><i>DISEASE AND LEECHCRAFT.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Serious maladies are inflicted by spirits or
induced by the vitiation of the triple force (v&acirc;ta, pita, sema)
which pervades the human body. In the former case they are cured by
devil dances and in the latter by drugs. There are, however, numerous
minor complaints where folk-remedies are employed.</p>
<p class="par">A cure for boils is to procure without speaking from a
smithy water in which the red hot iron has been cooled and apply it to
the affected parts.</p>
<p class="par">For whooping cough is given gruel made of seven grains
of rice collected in a chunam receptacle (kill&ocirc;t&ecirc;) without
uttering a word from seven houses on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p class="par">To cure a sprain a mother who has had twins is asked to
trample the injured place, without informing any one else, every
evening for a couple of days.</p>
<p class="par">A touch with a cat&rsquo;s tail removes a sty, and a
toothache is cured by biting a balsam plant (k&ucirc;dalu) uprooted
with the right hand, the face averted.</p>
<p class="par">When one is hurt by a nettle, cassia leaves (t&ocirc;ra)
are rubbed on the injured place with the words &ldquo;<span lang=
"si-latn">t&ocirc;ra kola visa ne&#7789;a kahambiliy&acirc;va
visa</span>, etc.&rdquo; (Cassia leaves are stingless but prickly is
the nettle).</p>
<p class="par">A firefly&rsquo;s bite requires &ldquo;the mud of the
sea and the stars of the sky&rdquo; to effect a cure&mdash;a cryptic
way of saying salt and the gum of the eye.</p>
<p class="par">Ill effects of the evil mouth and evil eye are dispelled
by various means:&mdash;either a packet made of some sand trodden by
the offender is taken three times round the head and thrown into a pot
of live coals; or a receptacle containing cocoanut shell ashes, burnt
incense, and a few <span class="corr" id="xd21e1391" title=
"Source: clouds">clods</span> of earth from a neighbouring garden is
buried in the compound.</p>
<p class="par">Patients suffering with small pox or a kindred disease
are kept in a separate hut, cloth dyed in turmeric and margosa leaves
are used in the room; and after recovery <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1396" title="Source: and">an</span> infusion of margosa leaves is
rubbed on their heads before they are bathed.</p>
<p class="par">A string of coral shows by the fading of its colour that
the wearer is ill; to prevent pimples and eruptions a chank is rubbed
on the face, when washing it.</p>
<p class="par">When there is a difficult child-birth the cupboards and
the doors in the house are unlocked. For infantile convulsions, a piece
of the navel cord is tied round the child&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p class="par">If one has warts on his body, stones equal in number to
them are tied to a piece of rag and thrown where three roads meet; the
person who picks up the packet and unties it gets the warts and the
other becomes free of them.</p>
<p class="par">When a person gets a hiccough, he gets rid of it by
holding up his breath and repeating seven times &ldquo;<span lang=
"si-latn">ikkayi m&acirc;yi G&acirc;lugiya, ikka, hital&acirc; man
&acirc;v&acirc;</span>&rdquo; (Hiccough and I went to Galle; he stayed
back and I returned).</p>
<p class="par">Extreme exhaustion will ensue if the perspiration from
one&rsquo;s body is scraped off; the cure is to swallow the collected
sweat. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1413" href="#xd21e1413" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A village community occupy a well defined
settlement (wasama) within which are the hamlets (gan), and in each
hamlet live a few families who have their separate homesteads
(mulgedera) with proprietary interests in the arable land and communal
rights in the forest, waste and pasture land. A group of such
settlements comprise a country district (rata, k&ocirc;rale,
pattu).</p>
<p class="par">There are two types of village settlements, in one there
are the free peasant proprietors cultivating their private holdings
without any interference, and in the other the people occupy the lands
subject to an overlord, and paying him rent in service, food or money
or in all three.</p>
<p class="par">All communities whether free or servile had, in ancient
times to perform r&acirc;jakariya for 15 to 30 days a year; in time of
war to guard the passes and serve as soldiers, and ordinarily to
construct or repair canals, tanks, bridges and roads. These public
duties were exacted from all males who could throw a stone over their
huts; the military services were, in later times, claimed only from a
special class of the king&rsquo;s tenants.</p>
<p class="par">The people had also to contribute to the Revenue three
times a year, at the New Year festival, (April) at the aluts&acirc;l
festival (January) and the maha or k&acirc;tti festival (November) in
arrack, oil, paddy, honey, wax, cloth, iron, elephant&rsquo;s tusks,
tobacco, and money collected by the headmen from the various country
districts. The quantity of paddy (kathh&acirc;l) supplied by each
family depended on the size of the private holding; but no contribution
was levied on the lands of persons slain in war or on lands dedicated
to priests. When a man of property died, 5 measures of paddy, a bull, a
cow with calf, and a male and female buffalo were collected as death
dues (marral.)</p>
<p class="par">The people are divided into various castes and there is
reason to believe that these had a tribal basis. The lower castes
formed tribes of a prehistoric Dravidian race (the Rakshas of
tradition) who drove into the interior the still earlier Australoid
Veddahs (the Yakkhas of tradition). The higher castes of North Indian
origin followed, and frequent intercourse with the Dekkan in later
historical times led to the introduction of new colonists who now form
the artisan castes.</p>
<p class="par">A caste consists of a group of clans, and each clan
claims descent from a common ancestor and calls itself either after his
name, or the office he held, or if a settler, the village from which he
came. The clan name was dropped when a person became a chief and a
surname which became hereditary assumed. The clan name was however, not
forgotten as the ancestral status of the family was ascertained from
it. The early converts to Christianity during the Portuguese ascendancy
in Ceylon adopted European surnames which their descendants still
use.</p>
<p class="par">The various castes can be divided socially into five
groups. The first comprising the numerically predominating
Rat&ecirc;ett&ocirc; who cultivate fields, herd cattle and serve as
headmen.</p>
<p class="par">The second group consists of the Naides who work as
smiths, carpenters, toddy drawers, elephant keepers, potters, pack
bullock <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1436" href="#xd21e1436"
name="xd21e1436">33</a>]</span>drivers, tailors, cinnamon peelers, fish
curers and the like.</p>
<p class="par">The Rat&ecirc;etto and the Naide groups wear alike, and
the second group are given to eat by the first group on a rice table of
metal or plaited palm leaf about a foot high, water to drink in a pot
and a block of wood as a seat; they have the right to leave behind the
remains of their meals.</p>
<p class="par">The third group are the Durey&acirc;s who work as
labourers besides attending to their special caste duties&mdash;a
kand&ecirc; <span class="corr" id="xd21e1443" title=
"Source: dureya">durey&acirc;</span> makes molasses, a batgam
durey&acirc; carries palanquins, a hunu durey&acirc; burns coral rock
in circular pits to make lime for building; a valli durey&acirc; weaves
cloth and a panna <span class="corr" id="xd21e1446" title=
"Source: dureya">durey&acirc;</span> brings fodder for elephants and
cattle.</p>
<p class="par">The fourth group consists of professional dancers,
barbers and washers. Of the professional dancers, the Neketto dance and
beat drums at all public functions and at devil and planetary
ceremonies, while the inferior Oli do so only at the Gara Yakum dance.
The washers are of different grades; Radav wash for the Rate
Ett&ocirc;, Hinnevo for the Naides, Paliyo for the <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1451" title="Source: Dureyas">Durey&acirc;s</span>, barbers
and Nekett&ocirc;, and Gang&acirc;vo for the Oli.</p>
<p class="par">The <span class="corr" id="xd21e1456" title=
"Source: Dureyas">Durey&acirc;s</span> and the group below them were
not allowed to wear a cloth that reached below their knees and their
women except the Radav females were not entitled to throw a cloth over
their shoulders.</p>
<p class="par">The <span class="corr" id="xd21e1461" title=
"Source: Dureyas">Durey&acirc;s</span> were given to eat on the ground
on a plaited palm leaf; water to drink was poured <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1464" title="Source: on to">onto</span> their hands and they
had to take away the remains of their meal. The fourth group had to
take away with them the food offered.</p>
<p class="par">The fifth group consists of the outcastes; the Kinnaru
and the Rodi who contest between themselves the pride of place. The
Kinnaru are fibre mat weavers who were forbidden to grow their hair
beyond their necks, and their females from wearing above their waist
anything more than a narrow strip of cloth to cover their breasts. The
Rodi are hideworkers and professional beggars; the females were
prohibited from using any covering above their waists.</p>
<p class="par">A guest of equal social status is received at the
entrance by the host and is led inside by the hand; on a wedding day
the bridegroom&rsquo;s feet are washed by the bride&rsquo;s younger
brother before he enters the house<span class="corr" id="xd21e1471"
title="Not in source">.</span> Kissing is the usual form of salutation
among females and near relatives and among friends the salutation is by
bringing the palms together.</p>
<p class="par">When inferiors meet a superior they bend very low with
the palms joined in front of the face or prostrate themselves on the
ground; when they offer a present it is placed on a bundle <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1476" title="Source: 40 of">of 40</span> betel leaves
and handed with the stalks towards the receiver.</p>
<p class="par">A guest always sends in advance a box of eatables as a
present; when the repast is ready for him he is supplied with water to
wash his face, feet and mouth; and the host serves him with rice and
curry, skins the plantains for him, and makes his chew of betel. The
males always eat first and the females afterwards; and they drink water
by pouring it into their mouths from a spouted vessel (kotale).</p>
<p class="par">At the guest&rsquo;s departure, the host accompanies him
some distance&mdash;at least as far as the end of the garden. When a
person of distinction, a Buddhist priest or a chief visits a house, the
rooms are <span class="corr" id="xd21e1483" title=
"Source: lined">limed</span> and the seats are spread with white
cloth.</p>
<p class="par">An inferior never sits in the presence of a superior,
and whenever they meet, the former removes the shade over his head,
gets out of the way and makes a very low obeisance.</p>
<p class="par">Seven generations of recognised family descent is the
test of respectability, and each ancestor has a name of his own: appa,
&acirc;t&acirc;, mutt&acirc;, natt&acirc;<span class="corr" id=

<p class="par">The system of kinship amongst the Sinhalese is of the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1500" title=
"Source: classificatary">classificatory</span> kind where the kin of
the same generation are grouped under one general term.</p>
<p class="par">The next of kin to a father or mother and brother or
sister are the fathers&rsquo; brothers and the mothers&rsquo; sisters,
and the mothers&rsquo; brothers and the fathers&rsquo; sisters; of
these the first pair has a parental rank and is called father (appa) or
mother (amma) qualified by the words big, intermediate or little,
according as he or she is older or younger than the speaker&rsquo;s
parents; their children are brothers (sahodarya) and sisters (sahodari)
to the speaker and fathers and mothers to the speaker&rsquo;s
children.</p>
<p class="par">The second pair becomes uncle (mam&acirc;) and aunt
(nenda) to the speaker qualified as before; their children are male
cousins (massina) and female cousins (n&ecirc;na) to the speaker, and
uncles and aunts to the speaker&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p class="par">Those who are related as brothers and sisters rarely
marry, and a husband&rsquo;s relations of the parental class are to his
wife, uncles, aunts and cousins of the other class and <i>vice
vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p class="par">These terms are also used as expressions of friendship
or endowment and also to denote other forms of kinship. The term
&lsquo;father&rsquo; is applied to a mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s
husband, or a step father; &lsquo;mother&rsquo; to a father&rsquo;s
brother&rsquo;s wife or a step mother; &lsquo;uncle&rsquo; to a
father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband or a father-in-law.
&lsquo;Aunt&rsquo; to a mother&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s wife or

or a maternal cousin&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;male cousin&rdquo; to a
brother-in-law or a paternal cousin&rsquo;s husband; &ldquo;female
cousin&rdquo; to a sister-in-law or a paternal cousin&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p class="par">The terms son, daughter, nephew, niece, grandson, grand
daughter, great grandson and great grand daughter include many kinsfolk
of the same generation. A son is one&rsquo;s own son, or the son of a
brother (male speaking), or the son of a sister (female speaking); a
daughter is one&rsquo;s own daughter, the daughter of a brother
(<span class="sc">M. S.</span>) or the daughter of a sister
(<span class="sc">F. S.</span>); a nephew is a son-in-law, the son of a
sister (<span class="sc">M. S.</span>) or the son of a brother
(<span class="sc">F. S.</span>); a niece is a daughter-in-law, the
daughter of a sister (<span class="sc">M. S.</span>) or the daughter of
a brother (<span class="sc">F. S.</span>); a grandson and grand
daughter are a &lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e1535" title=

and daughters are great grand sons and great grand daughters.</p>
<p class="par">Land disputes and the petty offences of a village were
settled by the elders in an assembly held at the ambalama or under a
tree. The serious difficulties were referred by them in case of a
freehold community to the district chief, and in the case of a subject
community to the overlord. A manorial overlord was invariably the chief
of the district as well.</p>
<p class="par">The paternal ancestral holding of a field, garden and
chena devolves on all the sons, but not on sons who were ordained as
Buddhist Priests before the father&rsquo;s demise, nor on daughters who
have married and left for their husbands&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p class="par">A daughter, however, who lived with her husband at her
father&rsquo;s house has all the rights and privileges of a son, but
the husband has no claim whatsoever to his wife&rsquo;s property, and
such a husband is advised to have constantly with him a walking stick,
a talipot shade and a torch, as he may be ordered by his wife to quit
her house at any time and in any state of the weather.</p>
<p class="par">A daughter who lives in her husband&rsquo;s home can
claim a share in the mother&rsquo;s property only if the father has
left an estate for the sons to inherit; she has, however, a full right
with her brothers to any inheritance collaterally derived. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1555" href="#xd21e1555" name=
"xd21e1555">35</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">She will not forfeit her share in her father&rsquo;s
inheritance if she returns to her father&rsquo;s house, or if she
leaves a child in her father&rsquo;s house to be brought up or if she
keeps up a close connection with her father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="par">After her husband&rsquo;s death she has a life interest
on his acquired property, and a right to maintenance from his inherited
property. Failing issue, she is the heir to a husband&rsquo;s acquired
property, but the husband&rsquo;s inherited property goes to the source
from whence it came.</p>
<p class="par">A child who has been ungrateful to his parents or has
brought disgrace on the family is disinherited; in olden times the
father in the presence of witnesses declared his child disinherited,
struck a hatchet against a tree or rock and gave his next heir an
<i>ola</i> mentioning the fact of disherision.</p>
<p class="par">There is no prescribed form for the adoption of a child
who gets all the rights of a natural child, but it is necessary that he
is of the same caste as the adopted father, and that he is publicly
acknowledged as son and heir.</p>
<p class="par">Illegitimate children share equally with the legitimate
their fathers&rsquo; acquired property, but not his inherited property
which goes exclusively to the legitimate children.</p>
<p class="par">Polyandry was a well established institution in Ceylon;
the associated husbands are invariably brothers or cousins. Polyandry
was practised to prevent a sub-division of the ancestral property and
also owing to the exigencies of the r&acirc;jak&acirc;riya (feudal
service); when the brothers on a farm were called out for their fifteen
days&rsquo; labour, custom allowed one of them to be left behind as a
companion to the female at home.</p>
<p class="par">Divorces are obtained by mutual consent; a husband
forcibly removing the switch of hair off his wife&rsquo;s head was
considered a sufficient reason for a separation. If a woman left her
husband without his consent it was thought illegal for her to marry
till the husband married again.</p>
<p class="par">Contracts were made orally or in writing in the presence
of witnesses, sanctioned by the imprecation that the one who broke
faith will be born a dog, a crow or in one of the hells, and the
contract was expected to last till the sun and moon endure.
Representations of a dog, a crow, sun and moon are to be found on
stones commemorating a royal gift. If a man contracts by giving a stone
in the king&rsquo;s name it is binding and actionable.</p>
<p class="par">A creditor forced the payment of his debt by going to
the debtor&rsquo;s house and threatening to poison himself with the
leaves of the niyangal&acirc; (gloriosa superba) or by threatening to
jump down a steep place or to hang himself; on which event the debtor
would be forced to pay to the authorities a ransom for the loss of the
creditor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p class="par">The creditor at times sent a servant to the
debtor&rsquo;s house to live there and make constant demands till
payment was made; and at times tethered an unserviceable bull, cow or
buffalo in the debtor&rsquo;s garden, who was obliged to maintain it,
be responsible for its trespass on other gardens, and to give another
head of cattle, if it died or was lost in his keeping.</p>
<p class="par">When a man died indebted, it was customary for a
relative to tie round his neck a piece of rag with a coin attached and
beg about the country till the requisite sum was collected.</p>
<p class="par">When a debt remained in the debtor&rsquo;s hands for two
years it doubled itself and no further interest could be charged. A
creditor had the right to seize, on a permit from a chief, the
debtor&rsquo;s chattels and cattle or make the debtor and his children
slaves. A wife, however, could only be seized if she was a creditor and
came with her husband to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1584" href=
"#xd21e1584" name="xd21e1584">36</a>]</span>borrow the money, and the
creditor could sell the debtor&rsquo;s children only after the
debtor&rsquo;s death. A man could pawn or sell himself or his children.
Children born to a bond woman by a free man were slaves, while children
born to a free woman by a bond man were free. If seed paddy is
borrowed, it is repaid with 50 percent. interest at the harvest; if the
harvest fails, it is repaid at the next successful harvest, but no
further interest is charged.</p>
<p class="par">If cattle be borrowed for ploughing, the owner of the
cattle is given at the harvest paddy equal to the amount sown on the
field ploughed.</p>
<p class="par">The King alone inquired into murder, treason, sacrilege,
conspiracy and rebellion; he alone had the right to order capital
punishment or the dismemberment of limbs; his attention was drawn to a
miscarriage of justice by the representation of a courtier, by the
aggrieved persons taking refuge in a sanctuary like the Dalad&acirc;
M&acirc;lig&acirc;va, by prostrating in front of the King&rsquo;s
palace and attracting his attention by making their children cry, or by
ascending a tree near the palace and proclaiming their grievances.</p>
<p class="par">The petitioners were sometimes beaten and put in chains
for troubling the King.</p>
<p class="par">For capital offences, as murder and treason, the
nobility was decapitated with the sword; the lower classes were paraded
through the streets with a chaplet of shoe flowers on their heads,
bones of oxen round their necks, and their bodies whitened with lime,
and then impaled, quartered and hanged on trees, or pierced with spear
while prostrate on the ground, or trampled on by elephants and torn
with their tusks. Whole families sometimes suffered for the offences of
individuals.</p>
<p class="par">Outcaste criminals like the Rodiyas were shot from a
distance as it was pollution to touch them. Female offenders were made
to pound their children and then drowned.</p>
<p class="par">The punishments for robbing the treasury, for killing
cattle, for removing a sequestration, and for striking a priest or
chief consisted of cutting off the offender&rsquo;s hair, pulling off
his flesh with iron pincers dismembering his limbs and parading him
through the streets with the hands about the neck.</p>
<p class="par">Corporal punishment was summarily inflicted with whips
or rods while the offender was bound to a tree or was held down with
his face to the ground; he was then paraded through the streets with
his hands tied behind him, preceded by a tom tom beater and made to
declare his offence.</p>
<p class="par">Prisoners were sent away to malarial districts or kept
in chains or stocks in the common jail or in the custody of a chief, or
quartered in villages. The inhabitants had to supply the prisoners with
victuals, the families doing so by turns, or the prisoners went about
with a keeper begging or they procured the expenses by selling their
handiwork in way-side shops built near the prison. The prisoners had to
sweep the streets and were deprived of their headdress which they could
resume only when they were discharged.</p>
<p class="par">Thieves had to restore the stolen property or pay a
sevenfold fine (wandia); till the fine was paid, the culprit was placed
under restraint (velekma): a circle was drawn round him on the ground,
and he was not allowed to step beyond it, and had to stay there
deprived of his head covering exposed to the sun, sometimes holding a
heavy stone on his shoulder, sometimes having a sprig of thorns drawn
between his naked legs.</p>
<p class="par">A whole village was fined if there was a suicide of a
sound person, if a corpse was found unburied or unburnt, or if there
was an undetected murder. In case of the breach of any sumptuary law,
the inhabitants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1607" href=
"#xd21e1607" name="xd21e1607">37</a>]</span>the offender&rsquo;s
village were tabooed and their neighbours prohibited from dealing or
eating with them.</p>
<p class="par">Oaths were either mere asseverations on one&rsquo;s eyes
or on one&rsquo;s mother or imprecations by touching the ground or by
throwing up handful of sand or by raising the hand towards the sun, or
by touching a pebble, or appeals to the insignia of some deity, or to
the Buddhist scriptures or to Buddha&rsquo;s mandorla. The forsworn
person was punished in this world itself except in the last mentioned
two instances when the perjurer would suffer in his next birth.</p>
<p class="par">There were five forms of ordeal, resorted to in land
disputes and the villagers were summoned to the place of trial by
messengers showing them a cloth tied with 3 knots.</p>
<p class="par">The ordeal of hot oil required the adversaries to put
their middle fingers in boiling oil and water mixed with cow dung; if
both parties got burnt the land in dispute was equally divided;
otherwise the uninjured party got the whole land.</p>
<p class="par">The other four modes consisted of the disputants
partaking of some rice boiled from the paddy of the field in dispute,
breaking an earthen vessel and eating of a cocoanut that was placed on
the portion of the land in question, removing rushes laid along the
boundary line in dispute, or striking each other with the mud of the
disputed field; and the claim was decided against the person to whom
some misfortune fell within 7 to 14 days.</p>
<p class="par">There were two other forms which had fallen into disuse
even in ancient times owing to the severity of the tests <i>viz.</i>
carrying a red hot iron in hand seven paces without being burnt, and
picking some coins out of a vessel containing a cobra without being
bitten. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1623" href="#xd21e1623"

<h2 class="main"><i>RITES OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When a mother is pregnant she avoids looking at
deformed persons, or ugly images and pictures, fearing the impression
she gets from them may influence the appearance of her offspring;
during this delicate period she generally pounds rice with a pestle, as
the exertion is supposed to assist delivery, and for the same purpose a
few hours before the birth of the child all the cupboards in the house
are unlocked. For her to cling to, when the pains of child-birth are
unbearable, a rope tied to the roof hangs by the mat or bedside.</p>
<p class="par">The water that the child is washed in after birth is
poured on to the foot of a young tree, and the latter is remembered and
pointed out to commemorate the event; a little while after the infant
is ushered into the world a rite takes place, when a drop of human milk
obtained from some one other <span class="corr" id="xd21e1635" title=
"Source: then">than</span> the mother mixed with a little gold is given
to the babe (rankiri kata g&acirc;nav&acirc;), and the little
child&rsquo;s ability to learn and pronounce well is assured.</p>
<p class="par">When the sex of the child is known, if it be a boy a
pestle is thrown from one side of the house to the other; if a girl, an
ikle broom; those who are not in the room pretend to find out whether
it is a she or a he by its first cry, believing it is louder in the
case of the former than of the latter. The cries of the babe are
drowned by those of the nurse, lest the spirits of the forest become
aware of its presence and inflict injury on it.</p>
<p class="par">At the birth of the first born cocoanut shells are
pounded in a mortar.</p>
<p class="par">The mother is never kept alone in the room, a light is
kept burning in it night and day, and the oil of the margosa is much
used in the room for protection; care is taken that the navel cord is
not buried and a little of it is given to the mother with betel if she
fall severely ill. Visitors to the lying-in-room give presents to the
midwife when the child is handed to them, especially if it is the
first-born one.</p>
<p class="par">A month after birth, the babe, nicely dressed and with
tiny garlands of <i lang="la">acorus calamus</i> (wadakaha) and
<i lang="la">allium sativum</i> (sudu l&ucirc;nu) tied round its wrists
and lamp-black applied under the eye-brows, is for the first time
brought out to see the light of day (do&#7789;&#7789;avadanav&acirc;);
and it is made to look at a lamp placed in the centre of a mat or
table, with cakes (kevum) made of rice-flour, jaggery, and cocoanut
oil, plantains, rice boiled with cocoanut milk (kiribat), and other
eatables placed around it. The midwife then hands round the little
child to the relatives and gets some presents for herself.</p>
<p class="par">The rite of eating rice (<span lang="si-latn">indul
katag&acirc;nav&acirc;</span> or <span lang="si-latn">bat
kavanav&acirc;</span>) is gone through when the child is seven months
old; the same eatables <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1660" href=
"#xd21e1660" name="xd21e1660">39</a>]</span>are spread on a
plantain-leaf with different kinds of coins, and the child placed among
them; what it first touches is carefully observed, and if it be kiribat
it is considered very auspicious. The father or grandfather places a
few grains of rice in the child&rsquo;s mouth, and the name that is
used at home (bat nama) is given on that day. The astrologer, who has
already cast the infant&rsquo;s horoscope and has informed the parents
of its future, is consulted for a lucky day and hour for the
performance of the above observances.</p>
<p class="par">The children are allowed to run in complete nudity till
about five years and their heads are fully shaved when young; a little
of the hair first cut is carefully preserved. From an early age a boy
is sent every morning to the pansala, where the village priest keeps
his little school, till a certain course of reading is completed and he
is old enough to assist the father in the fields. The first day he is
taught the alphabet a rite is celebrated (at pot tiyanava), when a
platform is erected, and on it are placed sandal-wood, a light, resin,
kiribat, kevum, and other forms of rice cakes as an offering to
Gan&ecirc;s&acirc;, the god of wisdom, and the remover of all obstacles
and difficulties. At a lucky hour the pupil washes the feet of his
future guru, offers him betel, worships him, and receives the book,
which he has to learn, at his hands, and, as the first letters of the
alphabet are repeated by him after his master, a husked cocoanut is cut
in two as an invocation to <span class="corr" id="xd21e1664" title=
"Source: Gan&eacute;s&acirc;">Gan&ecirc;s&acirc;</span>. A girl is less
favoured and has to depend for her literary education on her mother or
an elder sister; more attention, however, is paid to teach her the
domestic requirements of cooking, weaving and knitting, which will make
her a good wife.</p>
<p class="par">On the attainment of the years of puberty by a girl she
is confined to a room, no male being allowed to see her or be seen by
her. After two weeks she is taken out with her face covered and bathed
at the back of the house by the female inmates, except little girls and
widows, with the assistance of the family laundress, who takes all the
jewellry on the maiden&rsquo;s person. Near the bathing-place are kept
branches of any milk-bearing tree, usually of the jak tree. On her
return from her purification, her head and face, still covered, she
goes three times round a mat having on it kiribat, plantains, seven
kinds of curries, rice, cocoanuts, and, in the centre, a lamp With
seven lighted wicks; and as she does she pounds with a pestle some
paddy scattered round the provisions. Next, she removes the covering,
throws it on to the dh&ocirc;b&icirc; (washerwoman) and, after making
obeisance to the lamp and, putting out its wicks by clapping her hands,
presents the laundress with money placed on a betel leaf. She is then
greeted by her relatives, who are usually invited to a feast, and is
presented by them with valuable trinkets. Everything that was made use
of for the ceremony is given to the washerwoman. In some cases, till
the period of purification is over, the maiden is kept in a separate
hut which is afterwards burnt down. Girls who have arrived at the age
of puberty are not allowed to remain alone, as devils may possess them
and drive them mad; and till three months have elapsed no fried food of
any sort is given to them.</p>
<p class="par">The &lsquo;shaving of the beard&rsquo; is the rite the
young man has to go through, it is performed at a lucky hour and
usually takes place a few days before marriage; the barber here plays
the important part the laundress did in the other. The shavings are put
into a cup, and the person operated on, as well as his relatives who
have been invited, put money into it; this is taken by the barber; and
the former are thrown on to a roof that they may not be trampled
upon.</p>
<p class="par">Marriages are arranged between two families by a
relative or a trusted servant of one of them, who, if successful, is
handsomely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1674" href="#xd21e1674"
name="xd21e1674">40</a>]</span>rewarded by both parties. The chances of
success depend on the state of the horoscopes of the two intended
partners, their respectability which forms a very important factor in
the match, the dowry which used to consist of agricultural implements,
a few head of cattle, and domestic requisites, together with a small
sum of money to set the couple going, and, if connected, the distance
of relationship. Two sisters&rsquo; or brothers&rsquo; children are
rarely allowed to marry, but the solicitation of a mother&rsquo;s
brother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son is always
preferred to that of any other.</p>
<p class="par">A few days before the marriage, the two families, in
their respective hamlets, send a messenger from house to house to ask,
by presenting betel, the fellow-villagers of their own caste for a
breakfast; and the guests bring with them presents in money. Only few,
however, are invited to the wedding; and the party of the bridegroom,
consisting of two groomsmen, an attendant carrying a talipot shade over
him, musicians, pingo-bearers, relatives and friends, arrives in the
evening at the bride&rsquo;s village and halts at a distance from her
house. A messenger is then sent in advance with a few pingo-loads of
plantains, and with betel-leaves equal in number to the guests, to
inform of their arrival; and when permission is received to proceed,
generally by the firing of a jingal, they advance, and are received
with all marks of honour; white cloth is spread all the way by the
washerwoman, and at the entrance a younger brother of the bride washes
the bridegroom&rsquo;s feet and receives a ring as a present. A sum of
money is paid to the dh&ocirc;bi (washerwoman) as a recompense for her
services. They are then entertained with music, food and betel till the
small hours of the morning, when the marriage ceremony commences. The
bride and bridegroom are raised by two of their maternal uncles on to a
dais covered with white cloth, and having on it a heap of raw rice,
cocoanuts, betel leaves and coins. A white jacket and a cloth to wear
are presented by the bridegroom to the bride; betel and balls of boiled
rice are exchanged; their thumbs are tied together by a thread, and,
while water is poured on their hands from a spouted vessel by the
bride&rsquo;s father, certain benedictory verses are recited. Last of
all, a web of white cloth is presented by the bridegroom to the
bride&rsquo;s mother; and it is divided among her relatives.</p>
<p class="par">In connection with this presentation it is said that if
the mother-in-law be dead, the web should be left in a thicket hard by
to appease her spirit.</p>
<p class="par">On the day after the wedding the married couple return
to their future home with great rejoicing, and on their entering the
house a husked cocoanut is cut in two on the threshold.</p>
<p class="par">The tokens of virginity are observed by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s mother, and the visit of the parents and relatives
of the bride a few days after completes the round of ceremonies.</p>
<p class="par">There is a peculiar custom fast disappearing, and almost
totally extinct, called Kula Kanav&acirc;, that is, making one
respectable by eating with him. If a member of a family makes a
m&eacute;salliance he is cast out of his clan, and should he want his
children and himself to be recognized and taken back by the relatives,
the latter are induced to attend and partake of a feast given by him at
his house. The &lsquo;making up&rsquo; takes place when very many years
have elapsed, and only if the wife who was the cause of the breach is
dead. The difference due to marriage with another caste or nationality
is never healed up.</p>
<p class="par">Even in the presence of death, ceremonies are not
wanting; if the dying patient is known to have been fond of his earthly
belongings, and seems to delay in quitting this life, a few pieces of
his furniture are washed and a little drop of the water given to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1688" href="#xd21e1688" name=
"xd21e1688">41</a>]</span>him. A lamp is kept burning near the corpse,
the body is washed before burial and a piece of cotton or a betel-leaf
is put into its mouth. All the time the body is in the house nothing is
cooked, and the inmates eat the food supplied by their neighbours
(adukku).</p>
<p class="par">No one of the same village is told of the death, but all
are expected to attend the funeral; the outlying villages, however, are
informed by a relative who goes from house to house conveying the sad
news.</p>
<p class="par">The visitors are given seats covered with white cloth;
and the betel for them to chew are offered with the backs of the leaves
upwards as an indication of sorrow. Some times only the relatives come,
while friends leave betel at a distance from the house and go away
fearing pollution. It may be observed that, according to the Sinhalese
belief, pollution is caused by the attaining of puberty by a maiden
which lasts fourteen days; by the monthly flow of a woman which lasts
till she bathes; by child-birth which lasts one month; and by death
which lasts three months.</p>
<p class="par">Friends and relatives salute the body with their hands
clasped in the attitude of prayer, and only the members of the family
kiss it. The route along which the funeral proceeds is previously
strewn with white sand, and the coffin is carried by the closest
relatives, with the cloth to be given to the priests for celebrating
the service thrown on it, over white foot-cloth spread by the
dh&ocirc;bi, and preceded by the tom-tom beaters with muffled drums.
Lights are carried by the coffin and a shade is held over the head of
it.</p>
<p class="par">The service commences with the intoning of the three
Refugees of Buddhism and the Five Vows of abstinence by one of the
priests, and they are repeated after by those present, all squatting on
the ground. The cloth, referred to, is then given to be touched by the
bystanders in order to partake of the merits of the almsgiving; one end
of it is placed on the coffin, and the other is held by the priests.
They recite three times the Pali verse that all organic and inorganic
matter are impermanent, that their nature is to be born and die, and
that cessation of existence is happiness; and while water is poured
from a spouted vessel into a cup or basin, they chant the lines that
the fruits of charity reach the departed even as swollen rivers fill
the ocean and the rain-water that falls on hill-tops descends to the
plain. A short <i>ex tempore</i> speech by a priest on the virtues of
the deceased completes the service.</p>
<p class="par">If it be a burial, the grave is by the roadside of the
garden with a thatched covering over it. Two lights are lit at the head
and the foot of the mound, the bier in which the coffin was carried is
placed over it, and a young tree planted to mark its site.</p>
<p class="par">In a cremation, the coffin is first carried with music
three times round the pyre, and the latter is set fire to by the sons
or nephews with their faces turned away from it. Those assembled leave
when the pyre is half burnt; and, on the following day, or a few days
after, the ashes are collected and buried in the garden of the
deceased, over which a column is erected, or they are thrown into the
nearest stream.</p>
<p class="par">The party bathe before returning to the house, and are
supplied by the dh&ocirc;bi with newly-washed clothes; during their
absence the house is well cleansed and purified by the sprinkling of
water mixed with cow-dung; and the visitors before leaving partake of a
meal either brought from some neighbour&rsquo;s or cooked after the
body had been removed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1708" href=

<h2 class="main"><i>OCCUPATIONS AND INDUSTRIES.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the olden time, people were occupied according
to their caste, but now they pursue any vocation they choose, carefully
avoiding the inauspicious hours.</p>
<p class="par">One man works at his field or goes hunting and honey
gathering; a second fishes at the village stream with a rod made of the
midrib of the kitul leaf; a third slings his basket of garden produce
at the ends of a kitul shaft and carries them on his shoulders to towns
or village fairs; a fourth climbs the palm trees with his ankles
encircled by a ring of cocoanut leaf and picks the fruit with his hand;
a fifth taps for toddy the blossoms of several cocoanut trees by
coupling their crowns with stout ropes to walk upon and the straight
boughs with smaller ropes to support himself; a sixth brings for sale
from the county straw and firewood in single or double bullock carts
and a seventh transports cocoanuts, salt, and dried fish to centres of
trade by pack bullocks or in flat bottomed boats.</p>
<p class="par">The women either make molasses from the unfermented
toddy; or plait mats of dyed rushes in mazy patterns; or earn a
pittance by selling on a small stand by the roadside the requisites for
a chew of betel; or hawk about fruits and vegetables in baskets carried
on their heads; or keep for sale, on a platform in the verandah,
sweetmeats and other eatables protected from the crows which infest the
place by a net; or make coir by beating out the fibre from soaked
cocoanut husks; or attend to their domestic duties with a child astride
their hips; or seated lull their infant child to sleep on their
outstretched legs.</p>
<p class="par">Various ceremonies are performed in the sylvan
occupations of hunting and honey gathering.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hunting parties of the Kandian Sinhalese of the
North Central Province perform a ceremony which is very similar to that
of the Wanniyas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1725src" href="#xd21e1725"
name="xd21e1725src">1</a> and Veddahs<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1728src" href="#xd21e1728" name="xd21e1728src">2</a> when about
to leave their village on one of their expeditions in the forest. Under
a large shady tree they prepare a maessa, or small covered shrine,
which is raised about three feet off the ground, and is open only in
front; it is supported on four sticks set in the ground. In this they
offer the following articles if available, or as many as possible of
them:&mdash;one hundred betel leaves, one hundred arekanuts, limes,
oranges, pine apples, sugar cane, a head of plantains, a cocoanut, two
quarts of rice boiled specially at the site of the offering, and silver
and gold. Also the flowers of the arekanut tree, the cocoanut, and
ratmal tree. All are purified by lustration and incense, as usual, and
dedicated. They then light a small lamp at the front of the offering,
and remain there watching it until it expires, differing in this
respect from the practice of the Wanniyas, who must never see the light
go out. Before the light expires they perform obeisance towards the
offering, and utter aloud the following prayer for the favour and
protection of the forest deities, which must also be repeated every
morning during the expedition, after their millet cake,
gini-p&ucirc;va, has been eaten, before starting for the day&rsquo;s
hunting:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">This is for the favour of the God Ayiyan&acirc;r; for
the favour of the Kiri Amma, for the favour of the Kataragama God
(Skanda) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1733" href="#xd21e1733"

D&ecirc;vat&acirc;; for the favour of Kambili Unn&aelig;h&aelig;; for
the favour of Iland&acirc;ri D&ecirc;vat&acirc; Unn&aelig;h&aelig;; for
the favour of Kadavara D&ecirc;vat&acirc; Unn&aelig;h&aelig;; for the
favour of Gal&ecirc; Band&acirc;ra; for the favour of the Hat
Rajjuruv&ocirc;. We are going to your jungle (uyana); we do not want to
meet with even a single kind of [dangerous] wild animals. We do not
want to meet with the tall one (elephant), the jungle watcher (bear),
the animal with the head causing fear (snake), the leopard. You must
blunt the thorns. We must meet with the horn bearer (sambar deer), the
deer (axis), the ore full of oil (pig), the noosed one (igu&acirc;na),
the storehouse (beehive). We must meet about three pingo
(carrying-stick) loads of honey. By the favour of the Gods. We ask only
for the sake of our bodily livelihood<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1735src" href="#xd21e1735" name="xd21e1735src">3</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="par">The jungle attached to a village was the game preserve
of its inhabitants; game laws were concerned with the boundaries of the
village jungle, and with rights of ownership of the game itself. One
half of the game killed by a stranger belonged to the village, and the
headman of the village was entitled to a leg and four or five pounds of
flesh of every wild animal killed by the villagers.</p>
<p class="par">For regulating the time and manner of fishing in sea,
old communal rules have been legalised and are now in force. Fishing
with large nets (m&acirc;del) begins about 1st October and ends by May
31st in each year; the number of boats and nets to be used in each
inlet is limited; the boats and nets are registered and every
registered boat and net is used in the war&acirc;ya (inlets) by
rotation in order of register; the turn of each net and boat begins at
sunrise and ends at sunrise of the next day; the headman who supervises
these is called the mannandir&acirc;le. Whenever koralebabbu,
b&ocirc;llo, ehelamuruvo and such other fish come into the
war&acirc;ya, so long as these swarm in the inlet they should be caught
by rod and line and nothing else; when they are leaving the inlet, the
headman in consultation with at least six fishermen appoint a date from
which boru del or visi del may be used; on no account are mahadel
allowed to be used<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1742src" href=
"#xd21e1742" name="xd21e1742src">4</a>.</p>
<p class="par">Each of the boats with its nets belongs to several
co-owners and &ldquo;on a day&rsquo;s fishing the produce is drawn
ashore, is divided in a sufficient number of lots, each estimated to be
worth the same assigned value, and these lots are so distributed that
1&ndash;50 goes to the owner of the land on which the fish are brought
to shore, 1\4 to those engaged in the labour, 1&ndash;5 for the
assistance of extra nets etc., rendered by third parties in the process
of landing and securing the fish, which together equal 47&ndash;100 and
the remaining 53&ndash;100 go to the owners of the boat and net
according to their shares therein&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1749src" href="#xd21e1749" name="xd21e1749src">5</a>.</p>
<p class="par">Owners of cattle have brand marks to distinguish the
cattle of their caste and class from those of others; individual
ownership is indicated by branding in addition the initial letters of
the owner&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="par">Herdsmen who tend cattle for others are entitled in the
case of the bulls and the he buffaloes they tend to their labour, in
the case of cows and she buffaloes to every second third and fifth calf
born, and in the case of calves to a half share interest in the young
animals themselves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At the first milking of a cow there is a ceremony
called kiri ettirima. The cow is milked 3 different mornings
successively, when the milk is boiled, and poured into three different
vessels, till the whole is coagulated. On the fourth day, butter from
each vessel is preserved in a clean <span class="corr" id="xd21e1759"
title="Source: bason">basin</span>, to form the principal part of the
ceremony at a convenient time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1762"
href="#xd21e1762" name="xd21e1762">44</a>]</span>From that day the milk
may be used, but with particular care never to throw the least milk, or
any water that might have washed the milk basons, out of doors. When
the convenient time has arrived a bunch of plantains is prepared, cakes
are baked, three pots of rice are boiled, a vegetable curry, and a
condiment are prepared by an individual who must manifest all cleanness
on the occasion, even to the putting a handkerchief before his mouth to
present the saliva from falling into the ingredients. All these
preparations are brought to an apartment swept and garnished for the
purpose where the kapuva cleanly clothed enters and burns sandarac
powder, muttering incantations with the intent of removing all evil
supposed to rest upon the family, and of bringing down a blessing upon
them and their cattle.</p>
<p class="par">Next the kapuva takes 7 leaves of the plantain tree and
lays 5 of them in order on the table, canopied, and spread with white
cloth, in honour of the gods Wiramunda deviyo, Kosgama deviyo, Pasgama
deviyo, Combihamy, and Weddihamy; and the other 2 are put on piece of
mat on the ground in honour of the washer and the tom tom beater
supposed to have attended these supernatural beings. Over all these
leaves the boiled rice from one of the pots is divided, then from the
second and third. He afterwards does the same with the curry, and the
condiment, cakes, plantains etc., prepared for the performance. He then
pretends to repeat the same process by way of deception making a
motion, and sounding the ladle on the brim of the pots, as if rice and
other ingredients were apportioned the second time etc., to satisfy the
gods and the two attendants.</p>
<p class="par">The kapuva next takes a little of every ingredient from
all the leaves, both on the table and on the ground, into a cup (made
of leaves), and supporting it over his head marches out from the
apartment, closing its door; and he conveys it either to the fold of
the cattle, or to some elevated place where he dedicates and offers it
to the many thousands of the demons and their attendants who are
supposed to have accompanied the above particular gods, praying them,
by means of incantations, to accept the offering he has brought before
them. From hence he returns to the door of the apartment he had closed,
and knocking at it, as if to announce his entrance, he opens it and
mutters a few more incantations, praying the gods to allow them,
(including himself and the members of the family) to partake of the
remnants that have been offered in their honour. After these ceremonies
are performed, the kapuva, with all the rest, partakes of everything
that was prepared, and the owner of the cow may from this day dispose
of the milk according to his own pleasure.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="par">Rural rites differing in details in different
localities are observed by the Singhalese peasantry in their
agricultural pursuits.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1773src" href=

<p class="par">In all places a lucky day for ploughing is fixed in
consultation with an astrologer. It is considered unfortunate to
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1890" title="Source: bigin">begin</span>
work on the 1st or 2nd day of the month, and after the work is begun it
must be desisted from on <span class="corr" id="xd21e1893" title=
"Source: unluckcy">unlucky</span> days such as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th,
14th and 21st.</p>
<p class="par">Sowing is also commenced at a lucky day and hour
pronounced by the astrologer to be the most favourable. In a corner of
the field, on a mound of mud where are placed a ginger or a habarala
plant (arum maculatum), a cocoanut or an areka flower and some saffron,
is sown a handful of the first seed and dedicated to the gods; and
after that the entire field is sown.</p>
<p class="par">To drive away insects from the growing rice, charm-lamps
are lighted at the four corners of the field or a worm is enclosed in a
charmed orange and buried there or a fly or grub is fumigated with
charmed resin smoke and bidden to depart or a cultivator sounds a
charmed bell metal plate with a kaduru stick crying to the flies
&ldquo;yan yanta&rdquo; (please go).</p>
<p class="par">When the reaping time comes the portion of rice
dedicated to the gods is first reaped by some person who is not a
member of the proprietor&rsquo;s family. It is kept apart on an
elevated place till the reaping of the rest of the field is done when
it is cooked and ceremonially offered to the kapur&acirc;la.</p>
<p class="par">The threshing is done on a floor specially prepared;
when the crop is ripe a small pit is made in the centre of the
threshing floor in which are placed a margosa plant, and a conch shell
containing a piece of the tolabu plant (<span lang="la">crinum
asiaticum</span>) and of the hiressa (<span lang="la">vitis cissus
quadrangularis</span>), a piece of metal, charcoal and a small grain
sheaf. Besting on these is an ellipsoidal luck stone (arakgala), round
which are traced with ashes three concentric circles bisected by lines
and in the segments are drawn representations of a broom, a scraper, a
flail, a measure, agricultural <span class="corr" id="xd21e1910" title=
"Source: inplements">implements</span> and Buddha&rsquo;s foot
print.</p>
<p class="par">At the lucky hour the cultivator walks three times round
the inner circles of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1916" title=
"Source: theshing">threshing</span> floor with a sheaf on his head,
bowing to the centre stone at east, north, west and south and casts
down the sheaf on the centre stone prostrating himself. The rest of the
sheaves are then brought in and the threshing begins.</p>
<p class="par">The harvest is brought down on a full moon day and some
of the new paddy is husked, pounded, boiled with milk and offered to
the gods in a d&ecirc;vala or on a temporary altar under a tree by the
field, and followed by a general feasting.</p>
<p class="par">Persons cultivating their fields with their own cattle,
implements, seed paddy and the like receive the whole produce less the
payments of the watchers (warav&ecirc;ri) and the perquisites of the
headman.</p>
<p class="par">When the fields are given out to be cultivated for a
share of the produce, if the field owner supplies the cultivator with
the cattle, implements of labour, and seed paddy the produce is divided
equally by the owner and the cultivator; if the field owner supplies
nothing he only gets 1\4 of the produce.</p>
<p class="par">When an allotment of field is owned by several
co-owners, it is cultivated alternately on a complicated system called

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The entering of the sun into Aries is celebrated
as the new year&rsquo;s day; the ephemeris of the year is drawn up by
the village astrologer and the necessary information for the observance
of the festive rites is obtained by presenting him with sweetmeats and
a bundle of forty betel leaves.</p>
<p class="par">As the sun is moving into the sign Aries all cease from
work and either visit temples or indulge in games till a lucky moment
arrives when every family welcomes the new year with the strains of the
rab&acirc;na. Special kinds of sweetmeats and curries are cooked and
eaten, cloth of the colour recommended by the astrologer are worn,
calls exchanged, the headman visited with pingo-loads of presents, and
a commencement made of the usual daily work.</p>
<p class="par">At an appointed hour, the people anoint themselves with
an infusion of oil, kokun leaves (<i lang="la">swietenia
febrifugia</i>), kal&acirc;nduru yams (<i lang="la">Cyprus
rotundus</i>) and nelli fruits (<i lang="la">Phylanthus emblica</i>)
and an elder of the family rubs a little of it on the two temples, on
the crown of the head, and on the nape of the neck of each member,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">The birthday of the Founder of Buddhism is celebrated on
the full-moon day of May (wesak). Streets are lined with bamboo

title="Source: supertructures">superstructures</span> (toran) gaily
adorned with ferns and young king cocoanuts bridge highways at
intervals; lines of flags of various devices and shapes are drawn from
tree to tree; booths are erected at every crossing where hospitality is
freely dispensed to passers-by; and at every rich house the poor are
fed and alms given to Buddhist priests. Processions wend their way from
one temple to another with quaintly-shaped pennons and banners, and in
the intervals of music cries of s&acirc;dhu, s&acirc;dhu, are raised by
the pilgrims.</p>
<p class="par">The Kandy Pe&#803;rahe&#803;ra Mangalaya, begins at a
lucky hour on the first day after the new moon. &ldquo;A jack-tree, the
stem of which is three spans in circumference, is selected beforehand
for each of the four d&eacute;w&acirc;la&mdash;the Kataragama,
N&acirc;tha, Saman, and Pattini; and the spot where it stands is
decorated and perfumed with sandalwood, frankincense, and burnt resin,
and a lighted lamp with nine wicks is placed at the foot of the tree.
At the lucky hour a procession of elephants, tom-tom beaters and
dancers proceed to the spot, the tree is cut down by one of the tenants
(the wa&#7789;&#7789;&ocirc;rur&acirc;la) with an axe, and it is
trimmed, and its end is pointed by <span class="corr" id="xd21e2057"
title="Source: ano-other">another</span> with an adze. It is then
carried away in procession and placed in a small hole in a square of
slab rock, buried in the ground or raised platform in the small room at
the back of the d&eacute;w&acirc;la. It is then covered with a white
cloth. During the five following days the procession is augmented by as
many elephants, attendants, dancers, tom-tom beaters and flags as
possible; and it makes the circuit of the temples at stated periods.
The processions of the several temples are then joined by one from the
Dalad&acirc;, M&acirc;lig&acirc;va (the temple of the Sacred Tooth of
Buddha), and together they march round the main streets of Kandy at
fixed hours during the five days next ensuing. On the sixth day, and
for five days more, four palanquins&mdash;one for each <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e2060" title=
"Source: d&ecirc;w&acirc;la">d&eacute;w&acirc;la</span> are added to
the procession, containing the arms and dresses of the gods; and on the
last day the bowl of water (presently to be explained) of the previous
year, and the poles cut down on the first day of the ceremony. On the
night of the fifteenth and last day, the Perahe&#803;ra is enlarged to
the fullest limits which the means of the several temples will permit,
and at a fixed hour, after its usual round, it starts for a ford in the
river near Kandy, about three miles distant from the temple of the
Sacred Tooth. The procession from the M&acirc;lig&acirc;va, however,
stops at a place called the Ad&acirc;hana Maluwa, and there awaits the
return of the others. The ford is reached towards dawn, and here the
procession waits until the lucky hour (generally about 5 <span class=
"sc">A. M.</span>) approaches. A few minutes before its arrival the
chiefs of the four temples, accompanied by a band of attendants, walk
down in Indian file under a canopy of linen and over cloth spread on
the ground to the waterside. They enter a boat and are punted up the
river close to the bank for some thirty yards. Then at a given signal
(i. e., at the advent of the lucky hour) the four jack poles are thrown
into the river by the men on shore, while each of the four chiefs, with
an ornamental silver sword, cuts a circle in the water; at the same
time one attendant takes up a bowl of water from the circle, and
another throws away last year&rsquo;s supply. The boat then returns to
the shore, the procession goes back to Kandy, the bowls of water are
placed reverently in the several d&eacute;w&acirc;la, to remain there
until the following year; and the Perahe&#803;ra is at an
end.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2066src" href="#xd21e2066" name=

<p class="par">During the time of the kings, it was on this occasion
that the provincial governors gave an account of their stewardship to
their over-lord and had their appointments renewed by him.</p>
<p class="par">When the rainy months of August, September and October
are over and the Buddhist monks return to their monasteries from their
vas retreats, is held the Festival of Lights (K&acirc;rtika Mangalya).
The Buddhist temples are illuminated on the full moon day of November
by small oil-lamps placed in niches of the walls specially made for
them; in the olden times all the buildings were bathed in a blaze of
light, the Royal Palace the best of all, with the oil presented to the
king by his subjects. This festival is now confined to Kandy.</p>
<p class="par">The Alut S&acirc;l Mangalya, the festival of New Rice,
is now celebrated to any appreciable extent only in the Kandian
Provinces, the last subdued districts of the island. In the villages
the harvest is brought home by pingo-bearers on the full-moon day of
January with rural jest and laughter, and portions of it are given to
the Buddhist priest, the barber and the dhobi of the village; next the
new paddy is husked, and kiribat dressed out of it.</p>
<p class="par">In the capital, in the time of the kingdom, this
festival lasted for four days; &ldquo;on the first evening the officers
of the royal stores and of the temples proceeded in state from the
square before the palace to the crown villages from which the first
paddy was to be brought. Here the ears of paddy and the new rice were
packed up for the temples the palace and the royal stores by the
Gabad&acirc;nilam&eacute;s and their officers. The ears of paddy
carefully put into new earthenware pots and the grain into clean bags,
were attached to pingos. Those for the M&acirc;lig&acirc;va (where the
Sacred Tooth was kept) were conveyed on an elephant for the temples by
men marching under canopies of white cloth; and those for the palace
and royal stores by the people of the royal villages of respectable
caste, well dressed; and with apiece of white muslin over their mouths
to guard against impurity. This procession, starting on the evening of
the next day (full-moon day) from the different farms under a salute of
jingals and attended by flags, tom-tom beaters, etc., was met on the
way by the 2nd Adigar and a large number of chiefs at some distance
from the city. From thence all went to the great square to wait for the
propitious hour, at the arrival of which, announced by a discharge of
jingals, the procession entered the M&acirc;lig&acirc;va where the
distribution for the different temples was made. At the same fortunate
hour the chiefs and the people brought home their new rice. On the next
morning the king or governor received his portion consisting of the new
rice and a selection of all the various vegetable productions of the
country, which were tasted at a lucky hour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<p class="par first">On festive days itinerant songmen amuse the
village folk at open places and greens; they keep time to a dance by
skilfully whirling metal-plates or small tambourines on their fingers
or pointed stakes, by striking together sticks, by tossing earthen pots
up in the air and catching them and they eulogize the hamlet and its
people in extempore couplets with the refrain, &ldquo;<span lang=

<p class="par">The people also enjoy themselves on the merry-go-round
(katuru onchill&acirc;va)&mdash;a large revolving wheel on a tall
wooden superstructure with seats attached; at theatrical
representations called k&ocirc;lan ne&#803;tum, r&ucirc;kada
ne&#803;tum, and n&acirc;dagam; at games of skill and at divers forms
of outdoor games.</p>
<p class="par">K&ocirc;lan <span class="corr" id="xd21e2102" title=
"Source: netuma">ne&#803;tuma</span> is a series of mimetic dances of a
ludicrous character by actors dressed like animals and demons, wearing
masks and sometimes perched on high stilts.</p>
<p class="par">The r&ucirc;kada ne&#803;tuma is a marionette show of
the ordinary incidents of village life&mdash;usually of the adventures
of a married couple, a hev&acirc;rala (a militia guard) and his wife
Kadiragoda lamay&acirc;; the former goes to the wars and returns with
his eyes and ears off only to be beaten by his wife who soon after
falls ill with labour pains, and devil dancers are requisitioned to
relieve her; Pinnagoda r&acirc;la is the clown of the show.</p>
<p class="par">The n&acirc;dagama is a dramatic play and for its
performance a circular stage is erected with an umbrella-shaped tent
over it; round it sits the audience, who, though admitted free,
willingly contribute something into the collection-box brought by the
clown (k&ocirc;nangiya) at the end of the play. Before the drama
begins, each of the actors, in tinselled costume, walks round the stage
singing a song appropriate to his character. The piece represented is
based on a popular tale or an historical event.</p>
<p class="par">Games of skill and chance are played on boards made for
that purpose.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2111src" href="#xd21e2111"
name="xd21e2111src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">In Olinda Keliya a board having seven holes a side is
used; only two can take part in the game, and each in turn places
olinda seeds (<i lang="la">abrus precatorius</i>) in the holes and the
object of the opponent is to capture the other&rsquo;s seeds according
to certain rules.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2119src" href="#xd21e2119"
name="xd21e2119src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">In Pancha Keliya dice and six cowries are used; the
latter are taken into the player&rsquo;s hand and dropped, and the
shells which fall on the reverse side are counted and the dice moved an
equal number of places on the board and the game continues till all the
dice reach the other end of the board.</p>
<p class="par">In Deeyan Keliya sixteen dice representing cows and four
dice representing tigers are placed on a board and the cows have to get
from one side to the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2126"
href="#xd21e2126" name="xd21e2126">50</a>]</span>without being
intercepted and captured by the tigers.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the outdoor games played by adults are of the
ordinary kind, and others of a semi-religious significance.</p>
<p class="par">The ordinary outdoor games are Buhu Keliya, Pandu
Keliya, Lunu Keliya, Mutt&ecirc;, H&acirc;lme&#803;l&ecirc; and Tattu
penille.</p>
<p class="par">In Buhu Keliya there are several players who place their
balls, (made of any bulbous root hardened and boiled till it becomes
like rubber), round a pole firmly fixed to the ground; to this pole is
attached a string about 5 feet long held by a player whose endeavour is
to prevent the others getting possession of the balls without being
touched. The person touched takes the place of the guarding player and
when all the balls are taken away the last guard is pelted with them
till he finds safety in a spot previously agreed upon.</p>
<p class="par">In Pandu Keliya the players form into two sides, taking
their stand 100 yards apart with a dividing line between; the leader of
one party throws a ball up and as it comes down beats it with his open
palm and sends the ball over the line to the opposing side. If the
other party fails to beat or kick it back, they must take their stand
where the ball fell and the leader of their party throws the ball to
the other side in the same way. This goes on till one party crosses the
boundary line and drives the other party back.</p>
<p class="par">In Lunu Keliya there are two sets of players occupying
the two sides of a central goal (lunu) about 30 or 40 yards from it; a
player from one side has to start from the goal, touch a player of the
other side and regain the goal holding up his breath; if he fails he
goes out and this goes on till the side which has the greatest number
of successful runners at the end is declared the winner.</p>
<p class="par">In Mu&#7789;&#7789;&eacute; (rounders) a post is erected
as a goal, and one of the players stands by it and has a preliminary
conversation with the others:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Q.</i>&mdash;K&icirc;kkiy&ocirc;.</p>
<p class="par"><i>A.</i>&mdash;Muddar&ecirc;.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Q.</i>&mdash;Dehikatuvada batukatuvada&mdash;Is it a
lime-thorn or a brinjal-thorn?</p>
<p class="par"><i>A.</i>&mdash;Batukatuva&mdash;Brinjal-thorn.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Q.</i>&mdash;Man endada umba enavada&mdash;should I
come or would you come?</p>
<p class="par"><i>A.</i>&mdash;Umbamavaren&mdash;you had better
come.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as the last word is uttered, the questioner
gives chase, and the others dodge him and try to reach the post without
being touched; the one who is first touched becomes the pursuer.</p>
<p class="par">In Halmele there is no saving post, but the area that
the players have to run about is circumscribed; the pursuer hops on one
leg and is relieved by the person who first leaves the circle or is
first touched.</p>
<p class="par">Before starting he cries
out&mdash;H&acirc;l&#803;mel&eacute; A.&mdash;Kanakabar&eacute;.</p>
<p class="par">Q.&mdash;Enda hond&ecirc;? (May I come?).</p>
<p class="par">A.&mdash;Bohama hondayi (All right).</p>
<p class="par">In Tattu pe&#803;nilla also called Mahason&rsquo;s leap,
a figure in the shape of H is drawn; a player guards each line and the
others have to jump across them and return without being touched; it is
optional to leap over the middle line and is only attempted by the best
players, as the demon Mahason himself is supposed to guard it.</p>
<p class="par">The outdoor games with a semi-religious significance are
Polkeliya, Dodankeliya and ankeliya.</p>
<p class="par">In Pol Keliya the villagers divide themselves into two
factions called yatipila and udupila and the leaders of the two parties
take a fixed number of husked cocoanuts and place themselves at a
distance of 30 feet and one bowls a nut at his adversary who meets it
with another in his hand. This goes on till the receiver&rsquo;s nut is
broken when he begins to bowl. The side which exhausts the nuts of the
other party is declared the winner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2182" href="#xd21e2182" name="xd21e2182">51</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Dodan Keliya is a game similar to the Pol Keliya the
oranges taking the place of the cocoanuts.</p>
<p class="par">In An Keliya a trunk of a tree is buried at the centre
of an open space of ground; a few yards off is placed the log of a
cocoanut tree about 20 feet high in a deep hole large enough for it to
move backwards and forwards and to the top of it thick ropes are
fastened. The villagers divide themselves into two parties as in Pol
Keliya, and bring two forked antlers which they hook together and tying
one to the foot of the trunk and the other to that of the log pull away
with all their might till one of them breaks.</p>
<p class="par">In all these semi-religious games the winning party goes
in procession round the village and the defeated side has to undergo a
lot of abuse and insult intended to remove the bad effects of the
defeat.</p>
<p class="par">Children in addition to their swings, tops, bamboo
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2192" title=
"Source: pop&mdash;guns">pop-guns</span>, cut water, bows and arrows,
water squirts, cat&rsquo;s cradles and bull roarers have their own
special games.</p>
<p class="par">They play at hide and seek, the person hiding giving a
loud &lsquo;hoo&rsquo; call that the others may start the search; or
one of them gets to an elevated place and tauntingly cries out
&ldquo;the king is above and the scavenger below&rdquo; and the others
try to drag him down.</p>
<p class="par">Several children hold their hands together forming a
line and one of them representing a hare comes running from a distance
and tries to break through without being caught; or one of them becomes
a cheetah and the rest form a <span class="corr" id="xd21e2199" title=
"Source: lime">line</span> of goats holding on to each other&rsquo;s
back. The cheetah addresses the foremost goat saying &ldquo;<span lang=
"si-latn">eluvan kannayi man &acirc;v&ecirc;</span>.<span class="corr"
id="xd21e2205" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (I have come to eat
the goats) and tries to snatch away one of the players at the back; who
avoids his clutches singing &ldquo;<span lang="si-latn">elubeti kapiya
sundire</span>&rdquo; (go and eat the tasty goat dung); if one is
caught he has to hold on to the back of the cheetah and the game
continues till all are snatched away.</p>
<p class="par">When the children are indoors they amuse themselves in
various ways.</p>
<p class="par">They hold the backs of each other&rsquo;s hands with
their thumb and fore-finger, move them up and down singing
&ldquo;<span lang="si-latn">kaputu k&acirc;k k&acirc;k k&acirc;k,
goraka d&ecirc;n d&ecirc;n d&ecirc;n, amutu v&acirc;v v&acirc;v
v&acirc;v, dorakada gah&ecirc; puvak puvak, batapandur&ecirc; bulat
bulat, usi kaput&acirc;, us&icirc;</span>,&rdquo; and let go each
other&rsquo;s hold at the end of the jingle, which means that
&ldquo;crows swinging on a gamboge-tree (goraka) take to their wings
when chased away (usi, usi), and there are nuts in the areca-tree by
the house and betel-creepers in the bamboo-grove.&rdquo; They also
close their fists and keep them one over the other, pretending to form
a cocoanut-tree; the eldest takes hold of each hand in turn, asks its
owner, &ldquo;<span lang="si-latn">achchiy&eacute; achchiy&eacute;
honda pol gediyak tiyanav&acirc; kadannada?</span>&rdquo; (grandmother,
grandmother, there is a good cocoanut, shall I pluck it); and, when
answered, &ldquo;Oh, certainly&rdquo; (<span lang="si-latn">bohoma
hondayi</span>), brings it down. A mimetic performance of husking the
nuts, breaking them, throwing out the water, scraping the pulp and
cooking some eatable follows this.</p>
<p class="par">They twist the fingers of the left hand, clasp them with
the right, leaving only the finger-tips visible and get each other to
pick out the middle finger.</p>
<p class="par">They take stones or seeds into their hands and try to
guess the number, or they take them in one hand, throw them up, catch
them on the back of the hand, and try to take them back to the
palm.</p>
<p class="par">They keep several seeds <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2230" title="Source: of">or</span> stones in front of them, throw
one up and try to catch it after picking up as many seeds or stones as
possible from the ground.</p>
<p class="par">They hold the fingers of their baby brothers saying
&ldquo;this says he is hungry, this says what is to be done, this says
let us eat, this says who will pay, this says though I am <span class=

tickle them saying &ldquo;han kutu.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They keep their hands one over the other, the palm
downwards, and the leader strokes each hand saying, &ldquo;<span lang=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main"><i>STORIES.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Story telling is the intellectual effort of people
who have little used or have not acquired the art of writing. A story
is told for amusement by mothers to their children, or by one adult to
another, while guarding their fields at night in their watch hut or
before lying down to sleep after their night meal. At each pause during
the narration, the listener has to say &ldquo;hum&rdquo; as an
encouragement to the narrator that he is listening; and every tale
begins with the phrase &ldquo;eka mathaka rata&rdquo; (in a country
that one recalls to mind) and ends with the statement that the heroes
of the Story settled down in their country and the narrator returned
home.</p>
<p class="par">Stories are roughly classified as (1) myths, (2) legends
and (3) folk tales.</p>
<p class="par">(1) &ldquo;The myth,&rdquo; says <a id="xd21e2375" name=
"xd21e2375"></a>Gomme, <span class="corr" id="xd21e2377" title=
"Source: &rdquo; ">&ldquo;</span>is the recognisable explanation of
some natural phenomenon, some forgotten or unknown object of human
origin, or some event of lasting influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The crow and the king crow were uncle and nephew in the
olden time; they once laid a wager as to who could fly the highest,
each carrying a weight with him, and the winner was to have the
privilege of knocking the loser on the head; the crow selected some
cotton as the lightest material, while his nephew carried a bag of salt
as the clouds looked rainy. On their way up, rain fell and made the
crow&rsquo;s weight heavier and impeded his flight while it diminished
the king crow&rsquo;s burden who won the victory and still knocks the
crow on his head.</p>
<p class="par">The water fowl once went to his uncle&rsquo;s and got a
load of arekanuts to sell; he engaged some geese to carry them to the
waterside and hired a wood pecker&rsquo;s boat to ferry them over; the
boat capsized and sank and the cargo was lost, the geese deformed their
necks by carrying the heavy bags, the wood pecker is in search of wood
to make another boat and the waterfowl still complains of the arekanuts
he had lost.</p>
<p class="par">(2) A legend is a narrative of things which are believed
to have happened about a historical personage, locality or event.</p>
<p class="par">A cycle of legend has clustered round king Dutugemunu
who rolled back the Tamil invasion of Ceylon in the 4th Century B. C.,
and he is to the Singhalese peasantry what king Arthur has been to the
Celts. The old chronicles, based on the folklore of an earlier period,
place his traditional exploits in Magam Pattu, Uva and Kotmale. His
mother was Vih&acirc;re Devi; she was set afloat in a golden casket by
her father Kelani Tissa to appease the gods of the sea, who, incensed
by a sacrilege act of his, were submerging his principality of
Kelaniya; the princess drifted to the country of Hambantota and its
ruler Kavantissa rescued her and made her his queen. The coast on which
she landed is still remembered as Dur&acirc;va and has the ruins of a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2388" href="#xd21e2388" name=
"xd21e2388">54</a>]</span>vihare built to commemorate her miraculous
escape.</p>
<p class="par">Dutugemunu was her eldest son and when she was pregnant
she longed to give as alms to the Buddhist priesthood a honey comb as
large as an ox, to bathe in the water which had washed the sword with
which a Tamil warrior had been killed, and to wear unfaded waterlilies
brought from the marshes of Anuradapura. The town of Negombo supplied
the first and the warrior Velusumana procured the other two.
Astrologers were consulted as to the meaning of these longings and they
predicted, to quote the words of the old chronicler &ldquo;the
queen&rsquo;s son destroying the Damilas, and reducing the country
under one sovereignty, will make the religion of the land shine forth
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Dutugemunu was a lad, he was banished from his
father&rsquo;s court for disobedience and he passed his youth among the
peasantry of Kotmale till his father&rsquo;s death made him the ruler
of Ruhuna.</p>
<p class="par">Dutugemunu had a band of ten favourite warriors, all of
whom have independent legends attached to their names; along with them,
riding on his favourite elephant Sedol, he performed wonders in 28
pitched battles.</p>
<p class="par">He died at an advanced age, disappointed in his only son
Sali, who gave up the throne for a low caste beauty. The peasantry
still awaits the re-birth of Dutugemunu as the chief disciple of the
future Maitri Buddha.</p>
<p class="par">(3) A folk tale is a story told mainly for amusement,
deals with ideas and episodes of primitive life and includes elfin
tales, beast tales, noodle tales, cumulative tales and apologues.</p>
<p class="par">Elfin tales deal with the magical powers and the
cannibalistic nature of the R&acirc;kshas.</p>
<p class="par">A Gamarala&rsquo;s wife, while expecting a baby, weaves
a mat bag to collect the kekira melons when the season is on. The
Gamar&acirc;la goes out every day, enjoys the kekira himself without
informing his wife that the melons are ripe. The wife discovers that
the kekira is ripe from a seed on the Gamarala&rsquo;s beard. Both go
out to collect the kekira melons and fill the mat bag, when the wife
gives birth to a girl. They decide to carry the bag of kekira home and
throw the child into the woods as it is a girl. A male and female
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2405" title="Source: cranes">crane</span>
see this and carry the child to a cave. The cranes get a parrot, a dog
and a cat to be companions of the girl who all grow up together and the
girl is called &lsquo;sister&rsquo; by the pets. The cranes leave the
girl to dive for some pearls to adorn her and before departing advise
her not to leave the cave as there is a cannibalistic Rakshi in the
woods; they also ask her to manure the plantain tree with ash, to water
the murunga tree and to feed her pets especially the cat. The cat gets
a less allowance of food than usual and in anger puts out the fire by
urinating on it. The girl goes out to fetch fire and comes to the
Rakshi&rsquo;s cave and meets her daughter, who tries to keep the girl
till her mother comes by promising to give her fire, if she would bring
water from the well, break firewood and pound two pots of amu seed. The
girl does all this work before the Rakshi arrives and the daughter
gives her live coals in a cocoanut shell with a hole in it, so that the
ashes dropped all along her way. On the Rakshi&rsquo;s return she is
told of the girls&rsquo; departure and she follows up the ash track and
reaches the cave. The Rakshi sings out to the girl that the crane
father and crane mother have come with the pearls and to open the door.
The dog and the cat warn her from the outside and the Rakshi kills them
and goes away leaving her thumb nails fixed to the lintel and her toe
nails to the threshold. The cranes return and on the parrot&rsquo;s
advice the girl opens the door and comes out but gets fixed by the
nails and swoons away. The cranes think she is dead, but on removal of
the nails the girl recovers. They dress up the girl beautifully, cover
her with a scab covered cloth, tell her that she is too grown up
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e2408" href="#xd21e2408" name=
"xd21e2408">55</a>]</span>to live with them and bid her farewell. The
girl travels through the woods, becomes tired and meets the Rakshi; she
asks the Rakshi to eat her up but the Rakshi contemptuously passes her
by saying &ldquo;I do not want to eat a scab covered girl; I am going
to eat a beautiful princess.&rdquo; The girl arrives at a king&rsquo;s
palace and is employed as a help mate to the cook. She used to remove
her scab covered cloth only when she went out to bathe, and a man on a
kitul tree tapping for toddy saw her beauty and informed the king who
forced her with threats to remove her scab covering and married
her.</p>
<p class="par">In beast tales the actors are animals who speak and act
like human beings.</p>
<p class="par">A hare and a jackal sweep a house-compound; they find
two pumpkin seeds and plant them; the jackal waters his creeper with
urine and the hare waters his from the well; the jackal&rsquo;s creeper
dies; the hare generously agrees to share the pumpkin with his friend;
the jackal proposes a ruse to obtain the other requisites for their
meal; the hare lays himself on the road as if dead; pingo bearers pass
carrying firewood, cocoanuts, rice, pots; as each pingo carrier passes,
the jackal cries out &ldquo;keep that pingo down and take away the dead
hare; as they do so the hare scampers away and the jackal runs away
with the pingos; the jackal places the food on the fire and asks the
hare to fetch stalkless kenda leaves, the hare goes in search and the
jackal cooks and eats the whole meal leaving a few grains of rice for
the hare; the jackal places a cocoanut husk under his tail to act as a
stopper for his over-filled stomach; the hare returns without the
leaves and shares the remnants of the meal with the jackal; at the
jackal&rsquo;s request the hare strokes the jackal&rsquo;s back and
removes the cocoanut husk and is besmeared with excretion; the hare
runs to a meadow, rolls on the grass and returns quite clean; the
jackal asks him how he became so and the hare replies that the dhoby
has washed him; the jackal runs to the riverside and asks the dhoby to
make him also clean; the dhoby takes him by his hind legs and thwacks
him on the washing stone till he dies, saying &ldquo;this is the jackal
who ate my fowls.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The noodle tales describe the blunders of fools and
foolish husbands.</p>
<p class="par">Twelve men went one day to cut fence sticks and they
made twelve bundles. One of them inquired whether there were twelve men
to carry the bundles. They agreed to count and only found eleven men.
As they thought that one man was short, they went in search of him to
the jungle. They met a fellow villager to whom they mentioned their
loss. He arranged the bundles in one line, and the men in another and
said &ldquo;now you are alright; let each one take a bundle of sticks
and go home&rdquo; which they did as no one was missing.</p>
<p class="par">The people of Rayigam Korale threw stones at the moon
one moonlight night to frighten it off as they thought it was coming
too near and there was a danger of its burning their crops; they also
cut down a kitul tree to get its pith and to prevent its falling down,
one of them supported it on his shoulder and got killed.</p>
<p class="par">The country folks of Tumpane tried to carry off a well
because they saw a bee&rsquo;s nest reflected in the water; the men of
Maggona did the same but ran away on seeing their shadows in the
well.</p>
<p class="par">The Moravak Korale boatmen mistook a bend in the river
for the sea, left their cargo there and returned home; and the Pasdum
Korale folk spread mats for elephants to walk upon.</p>
<p class="par">In cumulative tales there is a repetition of the
incidents till the end when the whole story is recapitulated.</p>
<p class="par">A bird laid two eggs which got enclosed between two
large stones. The bird asked a mason to split open the stones; the
mason refused and the bird, asked a wild boar to destroy the
mason&rsquo;s paddy crop. The wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e2429" href="#xd21e2429" name="xd21e2429">56</a>]</span>boar
refused and the bird asked a hunter to shoot the wild boar. The hunter
refused and the bird asked the elephant to kill the hunter as the
hunter will not shoot the wild boar and the wild boar will not destroy
the mason&rsquo;s paddy, and the mason will not split open the stones.
The bird asked a bloodsucker to creep into the elephant&rsquo;s trunk,
but the bloodsucker declined. The bird then asked a wild-fowl to peck
at the bloodsucker as the bloodsucker would not creep up the
elephant&rsquo;s trunk, as the elephant would not kill the hunter; as
the hunter would not shoot the wild boar, as the wild boar would not
destroy the paddy crop of the mason who would not split the stones
which enclosed the birds&rsquo; eggs. The wild-fowl refused and the
bird asked a jackal to eat the wild-fowl. The jackal began to eat the
fowl, the fowl began to peck at the bloodsucker, the bloodsucker began
to creep up the elephants&rsquo; trunk; the elephant began to attack
the hunter; the hunter began to shoot at the wild boar; the boar began
to eat the mason&rsquo;s paddy; the mason began to split the stones,
and the bird gained access to her two eggs.</p>
<p class="par">Apologues are narratives with a purpose, they point a
moral and are serious in tone.</p>
<p class="par">The moral &ldquo;be upright to the upright; be kind to
the kind, and dishonest to the deceitful&rdquo; is illustrated by the
following tale. A certain man having accidentally found a golden
pumpkin gave it to a friend for safe keeping. When the owner asked for
it back his friend gave him a brass one; and he went away apparently
satisfied. Sometime after the friend entrusted the owner of the pumpkin
with one of his sons, but when the father demanded the son back, he
produced a large ape. Complaint was made to the king who ordered each
men to restore what each had received from the other. <span class=

insignia of the Deviyo. The two Pil select each its own horn or forked
stick; the horns or sticks are then entwined&mdash;one is tied to a
stake or tree, and the other is tied to a rope, which is pulled by the
two parties till one or other of the horns or sticks breaks. The Pila
which owns the broken horn is considered to have lost, and has to
undergo the jeers and derision of the winning party. If the Yatipila
which is patronized by the Deviyo (Pattini) wins, it is regarded as a
good omen for the removal or subsidence of the epidemic. The ceremony
closes with a triumphal procession to the nearest Dewale. A family

provide all that is required for strangers visiting the village and
generally to discharge the duties of hospitality for which the Kandyan
villages are celebrated. This entails upon the Ganwasama the necessity
of setting apart a place called the Idange for lodging strangers. The

Nanumura (new year), the Katti (feast of lights) in Il (November) and
the Alutsal (harvest home) in Duruta (January). Some reckon the old and
new year festivals as one, and number the Perehera in Ehala (July)

before the proprietor and attend to the ordinary repairs of his Wala,
awwa. In temple villages they likewise present their penuma, repair and

temple, mulutenge or kitchen, sometimes as often as three times a day.
It is carried from the kitchen with great ceremony on a Kada by the

Sabaragamuwa District after the harvesting of a middle crop between the
ordinary Yala and Maha crops, known as the Muttes harvest.</p>
<p class="par"><span lang="si-latn">MUTTETTUWA</span>: A field
belonging to the proprietor, whether a chief or temple, and cultivated
on his account jointly by tenants of every description. The proprietor
usually finds the seed-paddy, and bears all costs of agricultural
implements, and sometimes gives the buffaloes; the service of the
tenants is reckoned not by days, but by the number of the different
agricultural operations to which they have to contribute labour, and
they are accordingly spoken of as &ldquo;Wedapaha&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Weda-hata,&rdquo; which are&mdash;1, puran ketuma or puran-hiya
(first digging or first ploughing)<span class="corr" id="xd21e4632"
title="Not in source">;</span> 2, dekutuma or binnegunhiya (the second
digging or ploughing); 3, wepuruma (sowing including the smoothing of
the beds); 4, goyan-kepuma (reaping including stacking)<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e4635" title="Source: ,">;</span> and 5, goyan-medima
(threshing including storing). These admit of sub-divisions. Hence the
number of agricultural operations differ in different districts. All
the tenants take a part in the cultivation, and are generally fed by
the proprietor or by the Ganwasam tenants on his behalf. The sowing of
the seed-paddy is the work of the Gammahe as requiring greater care,
and irrigation that of the Mananna, unless special arrangements are
made for it with a Diyagoyya who is allowed in payment, a portion of
the field to cultivate free of ground-rent, or the crop of a cultivated
portion. The Muttettu straw furnishes thatch for buildings, the tying
and removing of which is also a service rendered by the tenants. The
services of the different classes of the tenantry on an estate are
centred in its Muttettu field. Hence the passing of the Muttettuwa from
the family of the landlord into the hands of strangers is invariably
followed by the tenants resisting their customary services in respect
of the Muttettu. They have generally succeeded in such resistance. See
first Report of the Service Tenure Commission P. 9. &ldquo;In only a
few cases have estates been sold away from the families of the local
chiefs, and in these cases with the almost invariable result of the
loss of all claim to service by disuse, the Kandyan tenant being
peculiarly sensitive as to the social status of his Lord. A few years
ago one of the leading Advocates in Kandy acquired three estates, and
after several years&rsquo; litigation, he was compelled to get the
original proprietor to take back the largest of the three, and the
claim to services from the other two had to be <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4638" title="Source: abondoned">abandoned</span>. On the original
proprietor resuming procession, the tenants returned to their
allegiance.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4641" title=

festival observed in the month of Ehela (July), in Dewale, the chief
ceremony in which is the taking in procession, the insignia of the
divinities Vishnu, Kataragama, Nata and Pattini for fifteen days. All
the Dewala tenants and officers attend it; buildings and premises are
cleansed, whitewashed, decorated, and put into proper order. The
festival is commenced by bringing <span class="corr" id="xd21e4985"
title="Source: n">in</span> procession a pole and setting it up at the
Temple in a lucky hour. This is done by the Kapurala; during the first
five days the insignia are taken in procession round the inner court of
the Dewale; the five days so observed are called the Kumbal-Perehera,
from Kumbala, a potter, who provided the lamps with stands called Kalas
generally used in some Dewala at the festival. During the next five
days, called the Dewala Perehera the procession goes twice daily round
the Widiya or outer court of a Dewale. During the third or last five
days, called the Maha or Randoli-perehera the procession issues out of
the temple precincts, and taking a wider circuit passes round the main
thoroughfare of a town. The festival concludes with one of its chief
ceremonies, the Diyakepima, when the insignia are taken in procession
on elephants to the customary ferry which is prepared and decorated for
the occasion; and the Kapurala, proceeding in a boat to the middle of
the stream, cuts with the Rankaduwa (golden sword) the water at the
lucky hour. At that very instant the &ldquo;Rankendiya&rdquo; (the gold
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4988" title="Source: goglet">goblet</span>)
which is first emptied of the water preserved in it from the Diyakepima
of the previous year, is re-filled and taken back in procession to the
Dewala. It is customary in some temples for the tenants to wash
themselves in the pond or stream immediately after the Diyake-pima.
This is a service obligatory on the tenants. After the conclusion of
the Perehera, the officers and tenants engaged in it, including the
elephants, have ceremonies, for the conciliation of lesser divinities
and evil spirits, performed called Balibat-netima, Garayakunnetima and
Waliyakun-netima. The Perehera <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e4991"
href="#xd21e4991" name="xd21e4991">80</a>]</span>is observed in all the
principal Dewala such as Kataragama, the four Dewala in Kandy,
Alutnuwara Dewale and Saman Dewale in Sabaragamuwa etc. The following
notice of the Kandy Perehera is taken from a note to the first report
of the Service Tenures Commission:&mdash;&ldquo;The most celebrated of
these processions is the Perehera, which takes place at Kandy in Esala
(July-Aug.) commencing with the new moon in that month and continuing
till the full moon. It is a Hindu festival in honor of the four deities
Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama (Kandaswami) and Pattini, who are held in
reverence by the Buddhists of Ceylon as Deviyo who worshipped Goutama
and are seeking to attain Nirwana. In the reign of King Kirtissiri (A.
D. 1747&ndash;1780) a body of priests who came from Siam for the
purpose of restoring the Upasampada ordination objected to the
observance of this Hindu ceremony in a Buddhist country. To remove
their scruples, the king ordered the Dalada relic of Buddha to be
carried thenceforth in procession with the insignia of the four
deities. Nevertheless, the Perehera is not regarded as a Buddhist
ceremony.<span class="corr" id="xd21e4993" title=

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
